# Value-Adding Activities

Warehousing should aim to provide value-adding services
as well as minimizing operating costs.
The four principal value adding activities are:
• Creating/Breaking
bulk consignments
(for better trans-
port economies)
• Combining freight
(postponement)
• Smoothing supply
to meet demand
(buffer stocks e.g.
in leagile supply
chains))
