# Work Organization

and Job Design
Automation and computerisation is reducing human intervention in the
physical handling of freight, and increasing information interaction which
has implications for job design.
Socio-Technical System Theory (STS) focuses on the impact of
implementing warehouse technologies on the workforce.
Fundamental principles
of STS theory are
• Joint optimisation
of the technical
and social system
• Quality of work life
• Employee participation
in system design
• Semi-autonomous
work groups
