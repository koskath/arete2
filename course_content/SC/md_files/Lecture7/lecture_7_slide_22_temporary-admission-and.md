# Temporary Admission and

Processing under Customs Control
Temporary Admission
Temporary admission allows goods to be used without payment of duty or taxes upon importation under certain conditions, provided that they are re‑exported afterwards in the same state. Releasing such goods into free circulation after use is normally not intended under this regime.
Processing under Customs Control
Processing under customs control postpones the assessment of duties and taxes until after processing in the EU, in cases where the processing leads to some degradation or change in the value of the goods, for example the denaturation of alcohol. 22
