# Release into Free Circulation

and Status of Goods
Release into free circulation means that all duties and taxes have been paid on non‑community goods so that they can circulate freely, with or without further surveillance by customs authorities depending on the type of goods and their end use. Regarding the status of goods, non‑Union goods are those originating from non‑EU third countries. Union goods, by contrast, include non‑Union goods after their release into free circulation, goods made in the EU based on (non‑)Union goods and goods fully raised or made from Union goods in the EU. Normally, the country of origin or heritage of the goods does not change even when their customs status changes in this way. 20
