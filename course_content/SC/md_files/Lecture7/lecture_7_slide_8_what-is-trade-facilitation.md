# What is Trade Facilitation?

According to Granger (2011), the topic of
trade facilitation has four interdependent
themes:
 The simplification and harmonization of
applicable rules and procedures;
 The modernization of trade systems,
and the sharing and lodging of infor-
mation between business and govern-
ment stakeholders in particular;
 The administration and management of
trade and customs procedures; and
 The institutional mechanisms and tools
to safeguard effective implementation
of trade facilitation principles and the
ongoing commitment to reform.
