# International Procedural Law

and Law of Sales Contracts
International Procedural Law
• Fall-back solution, whenever nothing else is agreed upon in a sales contract by
specific clause (i.e. choice of law, venue, arbitration, mediation)
• Here, each country regulates for himself autonomously in their international proce-
dural law, which is the proper law of a contract and which court have jurisdiction to
hear a case concerning parties from different countries.
• The overall principle is that the proper law of a contract is the system of law by
reference to which the contract was made or that with which the transaction had
is closest and most real connection (Rome Convention of 1980).
Uniform Law of Sales Contracts
• International Sales Contracts can be subject to the Vienna Convention
(UNCITRAL Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG))
of 1980, forming a uniform law of sales contract (apart from some exclusions for
special cases). In 1990, the CISG became status of national law in Denmark with
some reservations concerning Art. 92 and 94 (e.g. Inter-Nordic Trade)
• The CISG can only applied if the parties have their place of business in different
countries and both are contracting states of the CISG and/or the rules of their
private international law lead to the application of the law of a contracting state.
• The application of the CISG can be excluded by an explicit arrangement
(but this is not recommended)
