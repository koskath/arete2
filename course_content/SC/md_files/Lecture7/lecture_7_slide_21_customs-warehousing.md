# Customs Warehousing

and Entry in a Free Zone
Customs warehousing allows for the assessment of duties and taxes to be postponed until goods are released into free circulation or re‑exported. Union goods may also be placed in customs warehouses in order to benefit from export refunds or the repayment of import duties. Entry into a free zone, by contrast, involves moving goods into special areas within the customs territory of the Union where goods placed are free of duties and taxes. Control type I free zones have a perimeter fence so that goods placed there, under customs supervision, are automatically subject to this regime, while the rules for control type II free zones are essentially the same as those governing customs warehouses. For a list of free zones in the EU see `https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/document/download/adcde3a5-4d3b-4c73-b8d2-d0bfd459814b_en`. 21
