# Customs Warehousing

and Entry in a Free Zone
Customs Warehousing
Assessment of duties
and taxes postponed until
release in free circulation
(or re-exportation).
Union goods may be put in
customs warehouses, too, in order
to benefit from export refunds
or the repayment of import duties.
Entry into a Free Zone
Special areas within the customs territory of the Union. Goods placed within
these areas are free of duties and taxes.
Control type I free zones have a perimeter fence so that goods placed there, which is
supervised by customs, are automatically under this regime. The rules for control type II free
zones are essentially the same as those governing customs warehouses. For a list of Free
zones in the EU see:
