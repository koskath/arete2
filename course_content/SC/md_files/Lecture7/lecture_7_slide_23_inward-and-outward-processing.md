# Inward and Outward Processing

Outward Processing:
Outward processing allows Union goods to be processed abroad and then released into free circulation when they return, so that duty has to be paid only on the value added abroad. Inward processing, by contrast, is a suspension arrangement under which no duties and taxes are paid upon importation; after processing in the EU, the goods can either be re‑exported or released into free circulation. 23
