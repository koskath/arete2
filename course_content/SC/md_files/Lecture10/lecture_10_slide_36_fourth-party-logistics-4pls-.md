# Fourth Party Logistics (4PLs ®)

Offering total outsource supply chain solutions
Originally trademarked by Accenture in 1996
• A supply chain integrator that assembles and manages
the resources, capabilities and technology of its own or-
ganisation, with those complementary logistics service
providers, to deliver a comprehensive supply chain solution
• Actually asset-free, independent logistics intermediary
But the line between 3PL and 4PL ® is now blurred
as a lot of 3PLs now offer 4PL ® type solutions, too.
