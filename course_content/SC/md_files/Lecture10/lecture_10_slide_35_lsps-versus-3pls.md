# LSPs versus 3PLs

There is considerable overlap between the terminology used for logistics service providers (LSPs) and third‑party logistics providers (3PLs). All companies that provide transport and logistics services are LSPs, while those LSPs that provide multiple logistics services, often in an integrated form, are referred to as 3PLs. Typical 3PL services include transportation and customs clearance; warehousing and pick‑and‑pack operations; light manufacturing such as parts assembly; vendor managed inventory (VMI); trade financing; managing reverse logistics; parts distribution; and inventory management. 35
