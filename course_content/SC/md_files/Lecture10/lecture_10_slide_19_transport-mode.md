# Transport Mode

and Lead Times
Lead times are closely related to decisions on transport mode.
A valuable strategy is accounting logistics costs on a full-cost basis:
• Freight, insurance and handling costs
• Inventory carrying costs for products in transit and cycle stock
• Inventory carrying costs for safety stock
• Investment cost required to produce the inventory to fill the pipeline
