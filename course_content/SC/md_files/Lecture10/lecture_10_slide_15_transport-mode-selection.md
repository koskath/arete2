# Transport Mode Selection

A function of:
Transport mode selection is a function of several factors, including the weight, volume and value of the freight, the distance travelled, the availability and reliability of transport services and the freight rates to be charged, among other considerations. Instead of using only tare weight, carriers often apply volumetric charging based on consignment dimensions, usually abbreviated as W/M (weight or measure). Typical conversion factors are: for road and rail, 1:3 or 1 cubic metre (cbm) equals 333 kg; for sea freight, 1:1 or 1 cbm equals 1,000 kg; and for air freight, 1:6 or 1 cbm equals 666 kg. In practice, the higher of the weight‑based or volume‑based charge is always applied. 15
