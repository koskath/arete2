# Agenda

Transport Services
The first part of today’s session focuses on transport services. We will discuss the characteristics of different transport modes, the efficiency of transport services and the concepts of multimodal, intermodal and combined transport. We will also look at transport mode selection, taking the Belt‑Road‑Initiative (BRI) as an example. The second part concentrates on logistics service providers, including freight forwarders, third‑party logistics providers (3PL) and fourth‑party logistics providers (4PL). In addition, we will work with the case study “Missing Boxes in Central Europe”.
