# OSM-15
Or, for example, as you have it in the book, OSM‑15 presents the Sourcing/Purchasing‑System Design Matrix as a framework describing purchasing processes. Within this framework, combinations of **short** or **long** duration and **low** or **high** specificity are linked to different approaches such as **request for spot proposal**, **spot purchase**, **request for bid**, and **contract**. In addition, it includes mechanisms like **reverse auctions** and use of an **electronic catalogue**, as well as more relational arrangements such as **strategic vendor alliance** and **managed inventory**. Finally, the matrix highlights how these options are associated with **high** or **low transaction costs**, thereby helping to position different sourcing strategies in terms of duration, specificity, and cost, as summarised in Strategy & Configuration Slide 15.
