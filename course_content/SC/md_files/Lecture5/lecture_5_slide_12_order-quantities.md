# Order-Quantities

Order quantities can be managed using different rules, such as fixed quantity systems and policies that always fill up to a target level \(S\). In a fixed quantity \(Q\) system, a constant amount \(Q\) is ordered whenever the inventory position reaches a specified level, whereas in a “fill-up-to-\(S\)” system the order size varies so that inventory is brought back up to the level \(S\). These choices are closely related to reordering strategies, which answer the question of when to order and how much to order. 12
