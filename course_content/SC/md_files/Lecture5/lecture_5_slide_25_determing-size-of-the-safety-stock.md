//
50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Service Level
Inventory 84.13% 97.72%
Example:
When average demand = 100.000 units with standard deviation = 20,
(cid:3031)
average lead time = 1 period, and this is stable (ergo =0)
(cid:3013)
Then we need 2σ = 40,000 Units Safety Stock SS
for a Service Level of 97,72 % …. 25
