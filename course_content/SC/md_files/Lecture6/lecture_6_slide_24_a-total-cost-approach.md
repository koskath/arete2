# A Total Cost Approach

to Supplier Selection
Unit total cost (UTC) is defined as the unit purchase price amended by
an appropriate monetary factor to reflect other pure “hard costs” of an
item coming along with selecting a specific supplier.
It follows a five-step framework:
1. Identify all of the total-cost factors that are important to the organi-
zation. This is best done by inviting all stakeholders to identify cost
elements and other issues of interest to them regarding the source
of supply that is under evaluation.
2. Develop a "price adder" formula that will translate each total-cost
factor into monetary unit based on its perceived level of importance.
3. Add to each supplier's quoted price a debit (or credit) for each total-
cost factor, appropriate to that supplier's performance in relation to
those factors.
4. Add together the quoted price plus all total-cost factors to get unit
total cost.
5. Award the business to the supplier with the lowest unit total cost.
