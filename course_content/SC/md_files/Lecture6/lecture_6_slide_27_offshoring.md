# Offshoring

 Offshoring is the transfer of specific processes to lower cost locations
in other countries / regions
 Not the same as outsourcing
 Outsourcing involves handing process ownership over
to a third party
 In offshoring, the company may still own and control
the process itself in the lower cost location
 Sometimes nearshoring and backshoring happens…
