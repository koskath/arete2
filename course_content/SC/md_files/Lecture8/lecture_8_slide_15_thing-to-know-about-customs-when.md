# Thing to know about customs when

you do cross-border online shopping
Until recently, goods with a total intrinsic value ≤150 EUR were
exempt from import duties, and goods having a total value ≤ 10
EUR should be exempt from VAT on importation. EU Member
States may also grant an exemption on VAT for imported goods
which have a minimum total value 10 - 22 EUR (Council Directive
2009/132/EC of 19/10/2009).
Hence, goods were systematically declared below the VAT thres-
hold (22 EUR) to avoid VAT, customs duties and customs formalities.
Since 15/04/2021
All imported small consignments transported by postal service and express operators by air
must be covered by an electronic safety & security and a customs declaration.
Reduced data set for goods ≤ 150 EUR not subject to excise duties or restrictions.
Since 01/07/2021
All goods imported have to be declared and VAT to be collected (including < 22 EUR
goods). Import One Stop Shop (IOSS) system to collect VAT at purchase will make a
faster release at customs. Whenever IOSS is not used by the seller/shipper, VAT will be
charged at import (however, special arrangements for postal service etc. provided)
