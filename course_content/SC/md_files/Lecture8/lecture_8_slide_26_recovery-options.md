Reuse
• Reuse refers to a process in which the recovered product is used again
for a purpose similar to the one for which it was originally designed.
Remanufacturing
• Remanufacturing involves a process of
reducing a product into its constituent parts.
It requires more extensive work, often
complete disassembly of the product.

and disassembling used products, com-
ponents and materials, and separating
them into categories of like materials,
such as plastic, glass etc., and then
processing them into recycled materials.
