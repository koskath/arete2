# Logistics is driver of the development “shrinking
the world”
Logistics is a driver of the development that is “shrinking the world”. Historically, the best average speed of horse-drawn coaches and sailing ships was around 10 mph. Steam locomotives increased average speeds to about 65 mph, steamships to around 36 mph, propeller planes to about 400 mph and jets now fly at 500 to 700 mph. These dramatic increases in transport speed have effectively made the world smaller by reducing travel and delivery times.
