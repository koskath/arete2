Incoterms - Classification in Groups
With different rights and duties
Eleven (since 2011) Incoterms are split into four
distinct groups:
 Group E - where the goods are made available to
the buyer at the seller's premises;
 Group F - where the seller must deliver the goods to
a carrier appointed by the buyer;
 Group C - where the seller must contract for the
carriage of the goods without assuming risk of loss
of, or damage to the goods or additional costs due
to events occurring after shipment;
 Group D - where the seller has to bear all costs and
risks required to bring the goods to the place of
destination.
