# CIP – Carriage and Insurance paid to
Seller Buyer
Under CIP (Carriage and Insurance Paid To), the seller pays for carriage and insurance to bring the goods to the named destination, with the place of delivery being when the goods are transferred to the carrier. At that point, risk and cost transfer to the buyer, even though the seller covers the insurance and carriage.
