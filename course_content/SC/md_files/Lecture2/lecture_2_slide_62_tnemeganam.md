# DDP – Delivered Duty Paid
Seller Buyer
Under DDP (Delivered Duty Paid), the seller bears all costs and risks of bringing the goods to the named place of destination, including duties, taxes and other charges. Delivery takes place when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer at that place, and only then do risk and cost fully pass to the buyer.
