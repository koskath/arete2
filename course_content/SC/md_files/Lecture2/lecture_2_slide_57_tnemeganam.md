# CFR – Cost and Freight
Seller Buyer
Under CFR (Cost and Freight), the seller arranges and pays for the cost and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination, with the place of delivery being when the goods are loaded on board. Risk and cost transfer to the buyer at this point, even though the seller pays the freight.
