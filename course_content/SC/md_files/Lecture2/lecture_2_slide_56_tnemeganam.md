# CIF – Cost, Insurance, Freight Seller Buyer
Under CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight), the seller is responsible for the cost, insurance and freight to bring the goods to the port of destination, with the place of delivery being when the goods are loaded on board. Risk and cost transfer to the buyer at this point, although the seller pays for insurance and freight.
