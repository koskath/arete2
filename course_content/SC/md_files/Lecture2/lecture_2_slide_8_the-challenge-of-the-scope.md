# The challenge of the Scope?
Basic, extended and ultimate supply chains pose different challenges in terms of scope. At the most basic level, a seller–buyer partnership can be represented as a supplier, the focal firm and the customer, forming a basic supply chain. An extended supply chain adds the supplier’s supplier and the customer’s customer, as well as third-party logistics suppliers. An ultimate supply chain, in turn, further includes entities such as financial market providers and research firms around the focal firm, supplier and customer.
