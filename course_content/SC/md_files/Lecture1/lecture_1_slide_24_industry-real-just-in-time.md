# Industry: „real“ Just-in-Time
Industry illustrates “real” Just-in-Time through the integration of collaborating system partners into the production process. This involves a maximal length of the assembly line with minimal communication distance, just-in-time supply of modules, flexible and adaptable material flows, a “transmissable facade” and rework that is transparent in the center.

Examples of process steps include: (1) montage safety-bodyframe, (2) assembly gear-drive module, (3) glazing and seat system, (4) interior decor elements, (5) customized design system, (6) test run and functionality test, (7) quality audit and (8) a permanent forum for system partners.
