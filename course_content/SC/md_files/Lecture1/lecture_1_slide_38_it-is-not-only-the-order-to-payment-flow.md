# It is not only the order-to-payment flow
Supply chain management is not only about the order-to-payment flow. It also involves supply chain awareness in developing new business and supply chain ideas and in developing products. It requires attention to supply chain structure, meaning configuring your physical network and optimising resource allocation and facility locations.

Furthermore, it demands integrated processes, in which organisations, information systems and human resources are integrated into effective and efficient flows. Finally, adaptation and development are essential to keep your supply chain “state-of-the-art” and to adopt emerging technologies and ideas.
