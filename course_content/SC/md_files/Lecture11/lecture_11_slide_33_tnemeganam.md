Response
Language
• The exam is held in English!
• It is not an (English) language exam!
Some points to remember:
• Use easily understood language......demonstrate command of
technical terminology......demonstrate good academic style.....the
assignment is not improved if foreign words are thrown around.
• Use short sentences. Long sentences increase the risk of
confusion and ambiguity.
• Spend time proofreading and checking .....
• Be consistent in your argumentation and use of language.....
