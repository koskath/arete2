Handling „C-Parts“
One more up‑to‑date way of handling “C‑parts” is to use a KANBAN system with barcode scanning. In such a system, empty boxes with barcodes are scanned so that their information enters the scanning system and triggers replenishment. There is a clear distinction between the information flow, which is managed electronically, and the physical flow, in which boxes are refilled from supply stock and returned empties are collected, often on a weekly delivery cycle. Examples of companies applying such systems include Bossard, Keller & Kalmbach and Würth. 12.03.2025 Slide 22
