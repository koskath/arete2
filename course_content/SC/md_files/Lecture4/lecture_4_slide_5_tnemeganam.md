Scientific Management
 Workers experience/decision on their workload (Rules of
thumb) as “basic evil”: wrong incentive, wrong rules, shirking
 Developing of a “science” instead – some assumptions:
 Homo oeconomicus: Workers behavior as result of
material incentive
 According to related payment, human work can be
measured and calculated like machine work
 Task allocation: breaking task into smaller and smaller
tasks allows the determination of the optimum solution to
the task.
 For each task then the best routine can be found
 E.g. work analysis to select best shovel
 It is the job of the management not of the workers to find the
best way!
 Consequently, separate thinking and doing
 Thinking is job of the management
 Organization is job of the management
