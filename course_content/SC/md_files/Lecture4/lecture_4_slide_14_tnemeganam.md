History continued:
But also the other side of “Taylorism”
 Human work as a production factor:
 Workload and Bonus: Bringing the predefined daily workload
results in premium pay
 Fixation of the new Systems in operating instructions record cards
(bureau for work planning)
 Responsibility for the work design on foremen (bosses)
 But “Worker Reactions”
 “Congress investigated complaints by government workers and the
use of stopwatches was banned by law in government shops”
 “workers had gone on strike at the Watertown Arsenal when
specialists came in with stopwatches”
 “Taylor blamed this on union agitators but it was in fact directed at
Taylorism – skilled workers did not want to loosecontrol of their
work”
 “workers weren't convinced by Taylor's belief that rationalizing
management so that it was fair according to scientific principles
would eliminate the conflict between workers and management”
