# Are there other ways to organize production – Basic Layout-types Why, how?
There are several basic layout types for organizing production, each with its own characteristics, key advantages and key disadvantages. The production, or product, layout—also called a “line” or “flowshop layout”—uses a standardized processing sequence to achieve a smooth, rapid, high-volume flow. It typically involves a linear arrangement of specialized workstations to produce a specific product and supports high volume production with relatively unlearned but specialized workers, yet this comes with high initial setup costs and setup times and therefore makes the system inflexible. In contrast, a machine or process layout—often referred to as a “job shop layout”—groups centres or machines by the processes they perform, that is, by single tasks such as departments for sewing, kitting and other operations with more universal machinery. This allows for different product routings and offers flexibility, but it also creates a need for careful routing and scheduling and leads to more transportation between single production steps, along with additional setups. Finally, a fixed position layout is suitable for big single products or projects, where the product or project remains stationary and workers, materials and equipment are moved as needed. This kind of layout is used in projects where the product cannot be moved. Session 4 - Production and Global Production Networks Slide 11.
