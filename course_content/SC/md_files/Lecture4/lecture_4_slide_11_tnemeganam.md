Criteria for Basic Type - Characteristics Key Advantage
the Key Disadvantage
Organization
The production Product layout „line“, „flowshop layout“ High volume production with
• Layout that uses standardized processing unlearned but specialized workers
process
operations to achieve smooth, rapid, high- possible
volume flow High initial setupcostsand setup
•
Linear arrangement of specialized times; thusinflexible
workstations to produce a specific product
The machine Process layout , „job shop layout“ Allows fordifferent productroutings;
•
Centers/machines grouped by process they flexibility
processes
perform Need forrouting, scheduling, and
(single tasks) •
Departments (sewing, kitting…) more transportationbetween single
universal machinery productionsteps; + setups
The final Fixed Position Layout Suitable forbig single
•
Product/ project stationary; workers, products/processes
product
materials, and equipment are moved as „one time“
needed
•
Used in projects where the product cannot
be moved
