# Just to notice! “Operations” Management
Some more milestones in the history of operations management highlight how the field has evolved since 1900. Around 1900, Frederick Taylor introduced scientific management, while Frank Gilbreth developed motion study, and at the same time functional organization and cost systems were being established. In 1901, Henry Gantt created Gantt charts for scheduling and monitoring, and by 1910 Harrington Emerson was formulating efficiency principles. In 1913, Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line, and in 1915 F. W. Harris proposed the Economic Order Quantity concept for inventory management. From 1924 onwards, H. F. Dodge and G. H. Romig developed statistical techniques for quality control, while W. A. Shewhart contributed further to statistical quality control. In 1934, L. H. C. Tippett worked on activity sampling techniques, and in 1938 P. M. X. Blackett and others advanced operations research. The period from 1947 saw G. B. Dantzig’s applications of linear programming, while in 1949 Norbert Wiener and Jay Forrester contributed to systems analysis. Since 1950, numerous contributors have expanded computer applications in operations management, including statistical tables and simulation techniques, materials requirements planning (MRP), computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), decision theory, numerically controlled machines and robotics.
