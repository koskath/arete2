# Key decisions about inventory control and stock keeping?
When thinking about key decisions in inventory control and stock keeping, several fundamental questions arise. First, managers must determine the **size of the inventory** and the appropriate **time of stock keeping**, balancing holding costs against service requirements. Second, they need to decide **when to refill** and what will **trigger the refilling decision**, such as reorder points, review periods or specific demand signals. Third, they have to establish **how much to order or reorder** each time, taking into account economies of scale, variability and capacity constraints. Finally, they must decide **how many inventory points** there should be in the chain, which affects both responsiveness and total cost. These decisions are central to Strategy & Configuration 28.05.2019 (Slide 19).
