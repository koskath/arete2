# Approaches are using different dimensions and
variables and focusing on different aspects
Authors Dimensions Configurations can be summarized as follows. Fisher, 1997, uses uncertainty of demand and
product as key dimensions and distinguishes between a Physically efficient process and a Market responsive process,
so that uncertainty of demand and the nature of the product guide whether a physically efficient process or a market
responsive process is appropriate. Tan et al., 2000, also focus on the product dimension and arrive at a Market
responsive process. Christopher, 2000, emphasizes Variety/Variability and Volume, which lead respectively to an
Agile configuration and a Lean configuration. Mason-Jones/ Naylor/Towill, 2000, consider various (creating a hybrid)
and use Demand characteristics as a dimension to motivate an Efficient supply chain within a Leagile configuration.
Lee, 2002, uses Supply characteristics as a dimension and differentiates among a Risk-hedging supply chain, an Agile
supply chain, and a Lean Supply Chain. Corsten & Gabriel, 2002, work with Demand uncertainty, Product structure,
Speed Supply Chain, and strategic goal and identify configurations such as the Connected Supply Chain, Agile
Supply Chain, Speed Supply Chain, and Tight logistics segment. Finally, Klaas, 2003, uses coordination mechanism as
the key dimension and distinguishes between an Agile logistics segment, a Modular logistics segment, and an
Individual logistics segment.
