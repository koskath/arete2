# Logistics is driven by the economy
Logistics is fundamentally driven by developments in the economy, and increasing globalisation has far‑reaching consequences for logistics and supply chain management. As globalisation progresses, assembly and selling activities are influenced by a more intense **division of labour**, which in turn drives the use of plastics, bodies, software, keyboards (Tastatur) and other components, while also increasing the main storage distances that goods must travel in transportation. At the same time, new barriers emerge in **communication**, including differences in language, cultures and technologies, which can complicate coordination across borders. Moreover, there is growing **global competition for logistics service providers**, which raises the bar for performance and innovation. These changes require **different kinds of control** and create a need for **new competencies**, making logistics and supply chain management more challenging. Consequently, firms face greater **complexity** and heightened **risks**, as highlighted in Strategy & Configuration on 28.05.2019 (Slide 11).
