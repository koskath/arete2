# Key learning points: Session 13 Supply chain strategies and configurations
Content: Literature:
This session draws on several key pieces of literature. Mason-Jones, R, Naylor, B, & Towill, D (2000), 'Lean, agile or
leagile? SCM and the strategy hierarchy Matching your supply chain to the marketplace', International Journal of
Production Research, 38, 17, pp. 4061-4070, from module 4, provides an important foundation. Further supply chain
design considerations are discussed by Lee, H. (2004): The Triple-A Supply Chain, Harvard Business Review, Vol. 82,
No. 10, pp. 102-112, also from module 4. Supply chain strategic levers and decision-making components are explored
in Fisher, M.L. (1997) What Is the Right Supply Chain for Your Product?, Harvard Business Review, Vol.75, No.2,
pp. 105-116, and in Christopher, M., Peck, H. and Towill, D. (2006) A taxonomy for selecting global supply chain
strategies, International Journal of Logistics Management 17, No.2, pp. 277–287. Main issues are further illuminated
by Tallmand, S. (2018): Offshoring, Outsourcing, and Strategy in the Global Firm, AIB Insights, Vol. 11, No. 1,
pp. 1-6, and by The relationship between (firm) strategy & design and SCM in Gereffi, G. and Lee, J. (2012): Why the
World Suddenly Cares about Global Supply Chains, Journal of Supply Chain Management, Vol. 48, No.3, pp. 24-32.
Some broad questions that address the main issues concern The content of supply chain strategies and SCM-oriented
strategic positions. Q What is a supply chain strategy, and what is the content of such a strategy? Q What are the
typical strategies and configurations that may be employed for the design and management of supply chains, and how
do they relate to different SCM-oriented strategic positions?
