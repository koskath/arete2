# Key learning points: Session 2: The global context of logistics and supply chain management
The key learning points for Session 2 focus on the **global context of logistics and supply chain management**, combining both content and literature. On the **content** side, the session addresses globalisation and containerization, international trade and logistics, the logistics and SCM of cross‑border product movement, the global environment of logistics and SCM, global logistics and SCM applications, the steps, actors and institutions involved in the global supply chain process, and some first examples of mapping such processes; moreover, it touches on the purpose and scope of standards. On the **literature** side, Rodrigue, J‑P et al. (2020), in *The Geography of Transport Systems* (Hofstra University, Department of Global Studies & Geography, Chapters 5 and 7), provide an overview of transport geography, while De Koster, R. and Shinohara, M. (2006), in “Supply chain culture clashes in Europe. Pitfalls in Japanese service operations” (*Supply Chain Forum: International Journal*, Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 60–68), illustrate how cultural factors affect logistics and SCM. These topics lead to several broad questions that address the main issues of **complexity** in global supply chains, such as: What complications and relevant considerations arise in a global context of supply chain management? What are the elements of the global environment that impact logistics and SCM? Why do we need standards, and what is their purpose and scope? A case study, Flowers B.V., illustrates the complexity that can arise from the globalization of a supply chain. Altogether, these learning points are summarised on 29.02.2024 Slide 9.
