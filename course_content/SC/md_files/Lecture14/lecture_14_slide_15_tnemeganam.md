Are there other ways to organize production –
Basic Layout-types Why, how?
Criteria for the Basic Type - Characteristics Key Advantage
Organization Key Disadvantage
The production Product layout „line“, „flowshop layout“ High volume production with unlearned but
• Layout that uses standardized processing specialized workers possible
process
operations to achieve smooth, rapid, high-volume High initial setupcostsand setuptimes;
flow thusinflexible
•
Linear arrangement of specialized workstations to
produce a specific product
The machine Process layout , „job shop layout“ Allows fordifferent productroutings;
•
Centers/machines grouped by process they perform flexibility
processes (single
•
Departments (sewing, kitting…) more universal Need forrouting, scheduling, and
tasks)
machinery transportationbetween single production
steps; + setups
The final product Fixed Position Layout Suitable forbig single products/processes
•
Product/ project stationary; workers, materials, and „one time“
equipment are moved as needed
•
Used in projects where the product cannot be
moved
