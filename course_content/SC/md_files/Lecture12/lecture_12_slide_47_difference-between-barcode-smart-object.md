# Difference between Barcode & Smart Object
Technologies - RfID
 ID-number is written into an electronic tag
 Reader uses magnetic field or electromagnetic
waves in order to read the stored information
 Complex communication protocols are used for
communication between reader and tags
 In principle (depending on type of tag):
 No direct visibility is needed (but problems e.g. with
metal barriers)
 No alignment of reader and tag is needed
 Several 100 tags can be read at the same time
 Problems with fluids and metal objects inside the
packaging
