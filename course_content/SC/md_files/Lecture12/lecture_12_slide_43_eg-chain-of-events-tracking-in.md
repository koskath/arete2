# Eg. Chain of Events – Tracking in Transportation
Tracking in a chain of events for transportation covers the full route from long-distance haul to a sending depot, through short depot haul and pickup, and then via transshipment and reporting at a “hub” with V-NL-In and V-NL-Out events. From there, goods move to the shipper or receiver via hub-in and hub-out events, followed by E-NL-In and E-NL-Out events, and finally delivery via long haul and a receiving depot with short depot haul. Information points mark changes of status, which are put into the system via barcode or RFID tag.
