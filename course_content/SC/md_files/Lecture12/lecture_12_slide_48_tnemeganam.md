There exist a number of different RfID Tags –
e.g. Electronic Tags for Automation Purposes
 Used since the 80s for production and material flow
applications within industrial facilities
 Short reading and writing ranges (<< 1m)
 Relatively high costs per tag (between a few and
100 Euros depending on application area)
 Functions:
 Identification of objects in order to control material
flows inside the production line
 Storage of some larger amounts of data (up to 32
kByte and more) as compared to tags
 No bulk reading due to short reading and writing
ranges
