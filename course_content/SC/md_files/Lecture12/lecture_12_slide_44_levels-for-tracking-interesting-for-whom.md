# Levels for Tracking – Interesting for whom
Different levels for tracking are interesting for different stakeholders. At the vessel level, tracking can be carried out via AIS, linked to a vehicle identification number (VIN). At the container level, tracking uses GPS, GSM, GPRS, SAT or meshed networks and relies on the container number. At the shipment level, tracking focuses on single containers, again using GPS, GSM, GPRS, SAT or meshed networks to follow individual shipments.
