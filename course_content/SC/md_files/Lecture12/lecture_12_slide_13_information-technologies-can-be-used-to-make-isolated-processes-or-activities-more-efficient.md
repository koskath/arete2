# Phase 1: IT Support for basic Functions
In Phase 1, information technologies are used to make isolated processes or activities more efficient by providing IT support for basic functions. The goal is the automation of information processes for basic functions such as finance, for example through MRP systems or billing applications, as well as for sales and production. The benefits are higher efficiency for these isolated processes, and the result is a set of isolated IT solutions within different functions. However, existing processes themselves remain unchanged, so the potential of information technologies is only partially exploited. Source: Fleisch, E., Österle, H.
