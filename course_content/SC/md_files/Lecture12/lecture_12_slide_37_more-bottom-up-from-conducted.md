Orchestra” more towards the “Jazz-Combo”
 Jamming: work within a structure and live by its own
dynamics
 Agree on the general theme and focus
 Agree on certain rhythm
 Roughly agree on who plays when
Thus providing a stabilizing framework
 Interaction with self-control and interpretation
 Unscripted instead of Pre-planned
 “Real time” with current restrictions
 More alignment than transfer and processing of
Plans
 “Muddling through”: the best plan is always the
current one
