# Eg. Chain of Events in Transportation
The chain of events in transportation typically runs from long-distance haul to a sending depot, through short depot haul and pickup, via transshipment at a “hub”, and then on to long haul and a receiving depot, followed by short depot haul and final delivery. At each of these stages, the question arises: what information is needed for control and for triggering process activities?
