How is information read at the I-point? It can be read by human eyes, by optical reading devices with character recognition (OCR), by optical reading with mobile or stationary barcode scanners, or via radio waves in the reading area of antennas (poles or gates) for passive transponders and RFID tags. Where is the status information stored? It may be on the label, but more likely it is kept as a data record on a central database or central server, with data records for barcode-based systems and for passive transponder or RFID-based systems. Where and how is the required control activity triggered? Typically there is centralized matching of “as is” and “to be” states, with triggering based on this comparison for all three coding types. The basic advantages are that hand-written labels incur no additional costs, barcodes have no or limited costs and enable automation, and passive transponders or RFID tags offer low label costs, higher automation (no visual contact required) and bulk-reading (multi-tagging). The basic disadvantages or dangers include reading errors, typos and lack of motivation for manual labels, more likely reading errors with dirty or hidden barcode labels and single-reading limitations, and, for transponders or RFID tags, label costs, possible jamming by radiation, metal or interference and the need to manage such risks.
