# Tracking what, for whom, for what purpose?
Hierarchy and means in building logistical units are crucial for tracking and tracing. At the level of the transportation unit (TU), the means of transport are trucks, ships, planes and trains in international tramp traffic; here the tracked unit is the truck in the vehicle, and the identification is typically a vehicle identification number (VIN). Supporting means of transport, such as containers, waggons, swap trailers and trailers, form passive transportation units that are tracked using alphanumerical container numbers, often ISO container numbers. At the level of the load unit, global loading devices such as Behälter, pallets, reusable returnable transport boxes and unit load devices (ULDs) are tracked, for example via an asset identifier like the Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI). At the shipping unit level, packing units or bundles such as parcels, boxes, pallets and displays are used, while packages as sales units (barrels, bottles, cans, trays and parcels) are tracked in shipments using, for example, a Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC). Finally, bulk material as a quantity unit refers to the transport object or ware, including solids, gases and liquids, which must also be tracked appropriately.
