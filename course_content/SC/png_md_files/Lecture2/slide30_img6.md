A baby is wearing a costume that makes them look like a flower. The costume consists of a large, pink, petal-shaped structure surrounding the baby's face, with a yellow ruffled ring encircling the face, representing the flower's center. The baby is dressed in a full green suit, resembling a plant stem, with sleeves ending in green gloves. The suit covers the feet, which are also green. The baby is seated against a textured gray background, looking toward the camera with a smile. The costume features twelve evenly-sized pink petals. The texture of the background shows slight variations in shading, creating a subdued, mottled effect. The baby's pose is upright, sitting on the ground with legs bent and hands resting on its knees. The entire ensemble gives the appearance of a flower with the baby's face as the flower's center.
