The image shows a three-dimensional diagram resembling a circular table supported by a central, cylindrical pedestal. The circular surface serves as a map of the United States, illustrating state boundaries with minimal detail.

Four points are marked and connected with bold, straight lines converging towards the center labeled "Plant location":
1. In the northeast section labeled "Market."
2. In the northwest section labeled "Raw material 1."
3. In the southwest section labeled "Raw material 2."
4. In the southeast section labeled "Raw material 3."

Each of the three "Raw material" points is represented with a cylindrical object and is visually supported by thin vertical lines suggesting elevation from the table's surface. The "Market" and "Raw materials" labels are positioned close to their respective points outside the table surface.

The diagram foregrounds a broader concept of logistics and supply chain management, depicted with vectors symbolizing routes to a strategic "Plant location." The map and connectors are positioned above and parallel to the cylindrical base of the structure, which is shadowed to suggest solidity and depth.
