The image shows the lower part of a numeral, specifically the number “2”, in a bold, white font against a solid black background. The tail of the “2” curves downward, with a smooth curvature that loops lower on the right side. Adjacent to the “2” to the left is the partially visible end of a white diagonal line, possibly the base of a “1” but not fully visible, angled from the top left downward toward the lower center. The background is completely black, providing a stark contrast to the white text. There are no additional markings, annotations, or elements visible in the image.
