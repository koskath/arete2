The image consists of white stylized letters on a black background. The letters form an abstract design, resembling the word "LION". 

1. The first character resembles an uppercase "L", but with a rounded top and bottom instead of sharp corners, slightly tilted counter-clockwise.
2. The second character is a stylized "I", represented by a vertical line, also tilted counter-clockwise, appearing to slant toward the right.
3. The third character depicts an "O", perfectly circular in shape and tilted along with the other characters.
4. The final character is a stylized "N", with the right vertical line of the "N" connected to the left diagonal line, forming a continuous, flowing shape and also tilted counter-clockwise.

The overall design gives the appearance of the word "LION" through modern, abstract, and tilted representations of the characters.
