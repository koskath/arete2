The image shows a rectangular cuboid with three visible faces, depicted in a light blue hue. The top and side faces appear as parallelograms due to the perspective. The top face is slanted to the right, and the side face is slanted to the left. There is a thin black line running vertically on the front face of the cuboid, dividing it into two sections, with the left section slightly wider than the right. To the left of the cuboid, there is a black arrow pointing to the right, aligned with the top of the front face. At the bottom right corner of the image, there is a stylized black letter "Z," partially overlapping with the bottom of the cuboid.
