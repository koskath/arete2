The image is a timeline illustrating the evolution of transport modes across centuries, separated into three main categories: Air, Land, and Maritime. The timeline is divided into four vertical sections labeled as "17-18th Century," "19th Century," "20th Century," and "21st Century."

1. **Air:**
   - **20th Century:** A horizontal bar labeled "Airports" with an image of several airplanes and airport runways. Below it reads "Global mobility systems."

2. **Land:**
