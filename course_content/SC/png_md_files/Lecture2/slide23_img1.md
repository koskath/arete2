The image is a combination graph comprising a bar chart and a line graph titled "Total world container handling." It includes the following elements:

- **X-axis (Horizontal):** 
  - Labeled with years from left to right: 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 00, 02, 04, 06, 08, and 10.

- **Left Y-axis (Vertical):** 
  - Measures "Container handling, m TEU" with values from 0 to 600, marked at intervals of 100 (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600).

- **Right Y-axis (Vertical):** 
  - Measures "% yoy" with values from 0 to 18, marked at intervals of 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18).

- **Bar Chart (Blue Bars):** 
  - Represents "Container handling, m TEU."
  - Each bar corresponds to a specific year, starting at 90 and ending at 10.
  - The bars increase in height over time, beginning around 100 m TEU in 90 and peaking near 550 m TEU in 08, then slightly decreasing by 10.

- **Line Graph (Black Line):** 
  - Represents "% yoy."
  - The line fluctuates through the years, showing several peaks and troughs:
    - It begins around 6 in 90.
    - Peaks to about 9 around 94, then declines.
    - Another peak near 8 in 00, then down to below 0 in 02.
    - A notable sharp peak just above 15 in 07.
    - A drastic dip to slightly below -3 in 09, rebounding above 12 in 10.

- **Background Shading:**
  - A shaded vertical band appears from 08 to 10, highlighting this period.

- **Legend (Bottom Left):** 
  - Blue square with "Container handling, m TEU (left)."
  - Gray line with "% yoy (right)."

- **Sources (Bottom Center):** 
  - Text indicates "Sources: Drewry, DB Research."

The graph illustrates trends in total world container handling and percentage year-over-year changes from 1990 to 2010.
