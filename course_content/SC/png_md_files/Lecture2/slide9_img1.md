The image shows a two-dimensional shape resembling a horizontal arrow pointing to the right. The arrow's body is a wide rectangular shape with a shallow gradient fill, starting with a light blue at the top and fading to white towards the bottom. On the left side, it features a triangular black arrowhead pointing left. The rectangular shape has two parallel longer sides and converges into the black arrowhead at the left. The right side of the rectangle is not pointed but forms a straight edge. The gradient gives the entire shape a subtle, three-dimensional appearance. There are no visible annotations, labels, or additional elements within the image. The entire shape is bordered by a thin black outline.
