The image displays the cover of a board game titled "RISK." Dominating the top section of the image is the bold, capitalized word "RISK" in large red letters with a white and black outline against a backdrop of flames. Below the word "RISK," a military general in a blue uniform is prominently shown riding a rearing white horse. He holds a raised sword in his right hand.

The background consists of a stylized map of the world, with a prominent yellow-orange color scheme transitioning to darker orange and brown hues towards the edges of the image, giving the appearance of a sunset or fire. Surrounding the central figure on horseback are several soldiers in military uniforms, positioned symmetrically on both sides and facing outward. They carry flags with different colors and designs and sit on cannons, reinforcing the theme of battle. 

At the bottom center of the image, spanning across the map, the text "The Game of Global Domination" is displayed in a bold, black, sans-serif font. There are small logo markings in the bottom corners. The entire image is framed with a shiny, cellophane-like texture suggesting it is wrapped or protected.
