The image displays a flowchart with the title "Map 2: Flow of material and information between and within key unit operations." It comprises a series of rectangular boxes representing different processes, connected by arrows indicating the direction of material flow. 

1. At the top left, a box labeled "buying pre-blend" has an arrow pointing right to a box labeled "Raws w/h."

2. The "Raws w/h" box has two arrows: one points right to a box labeled "Processing," and the other is a backward loop arrow pointing back to "buying pre-blend." This looped arrow is accompanied by the text "% Raw Returns % PKG Returns."

3. The "Processing" box has an arrow pointing right to a box labeled "Fill."

4. The "Fill" box has two outputs:
   - One arrow pointing right, passing through a dashed line labeled with "Replenishment model," to a box labeled "2ndry packing."
   - A vertical arrow downward to a box labeled "Pack Mtls w/h."

5. The "2ndry packing" box has an arrow pointing right to a box labeled "FG w/h."

6. The "FG w/h" box has an arrow pointing right to a box labeled "RDC."

7. Below these main process boxes, there are three parallel horizontal arrows pointing towards "Pack Mtls w/h," with one labeled "primary."

8. Arrows connecting the boxes are solid black lines, except for the dashed line between "Fill" and "2ndry packing."

The layout shows a horizontal flow from left to right, with additional feedback loops and storage connections between processes. The arrows and labels indicate the direction and type of materials or information moving between the operations.
