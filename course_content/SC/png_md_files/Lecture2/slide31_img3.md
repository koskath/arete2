The image shows a portion of white, lowercase characters on a black background. The visible part of the image includes the right half of the character "s" with a smooth curve on the top left side. Next to it, a rounded "u" is evident, where only the left half of the character is cut off, but the bottom curve is visible. To the right of the "u," a part of a "p" is visible, specifically the loop section only, with the straight vertical stem not shown. The characters appear slightly rotated or slanted to the right, suggesting a layout other than straightforward horizontal alignment.
