The image features a blue background with a large, centrally positioned swan flying toward the left. The swan is shown in side profile with its wings outstretched. Below the swan, there is white text in a serif font reading “The Reliable Airline.” To the right of this text is the logo “KLM,” which is in bold capital letters. Above the “KLM” text is a small crown-like symbol composed of a horizontal line topped with a row of small circles. The overall composition conveys a sense of movement and contrasts the white elements against the blue background.
