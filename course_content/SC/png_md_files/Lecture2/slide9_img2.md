The image shows a trapezoidal shape with a light blue fill and a black outline. The trapezoid has a horizontal top side and a slightly longer horizontal bottom side. The left and right sides are diagonal, slanting inward from bottom to top. The shape is bisected by a vertical line extending from the midpoint of the top side to the midpoint of the bottom side.

On the left side, there is a thick black arrow pointing to the right, positioned above and extending parallel to the top side of the trapezoid. Below this arrow, the letter "Z" is inscribed in black, located close to the top left corner of the trapezoid.

The bottom left corner of the trapezoid is occupied by a right-angled triangle, created by a diagonal line extending from the leftmost point of the bottom side upwards and to the right, intersecting the vertical side of the trapezoid.

Overall, the structure appears symmetrical along the vertical bisecting line.
