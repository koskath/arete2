Level 1: The top section contains a rectangle with four smaller rectangles inside, horizontally aligned. An arrow labeled "Process" points to the entire rectangle. Another arrow labeled "Process Element" points to one of the smaller rectangles.

Level 2: Below Level 1, this section shows a similar rectangle with four smaller rectangles inside. An arrow labeled "Process Element" points to one of the smaller rectangles, and another arrow labeled "Task" points to the entire rectangle. These two levels are connected by a narrowing, shaded funnel-like shape.

Level 3: Below Level 2 is another rectangle with four smaller rectangles inside. An arrow labeled "Task" points to one of the smaller rectangles, and another arrow labeled "Activities" points to the entire rectangle. A similar funnel-like shape connects this level to Level 2.

Level 4: At the bottom, this section features a rectangle containing multiple horizontal lines stacked vertically, resembling a list. An arrow labeled "Activities" points to the rectangle. The funnel-like connector also connects Level 3 and Level 4.

To the right, there are four bullet points with blue arrowhead icons:

1. "Provide a balanced horizontal (cross-process) and vertical (hierarchical) view"
2. "Designed to be (re)configurable"
3. "Used to represent many different configurations of a similar process"
4. "Aggregate a series of hierarchical process models"

Each bullet point has a right-facing blue arrowhead icon.
