The image is a diagram titled "Map 1: Supply network structure," set within a rectangular box. The diagram features several components:

1. **Tiers**:
   - "Tier 3" is located on the far left, represented by a vertical oval with a light gray fill. Inside the oval is the text "> 500".
   - An arrow points right from "Tier 3" to "Tier 2".
   - "Tier 2" is represented by another vertical oval with a light gray fill, containing the text "> 300".
   - An arrow points right from "Tier 2" to "Tier 1".
   - "Tier 1" is shown as a smaller vertical oval with a light gray fill, containing the text "75".
   - An unlabeled arrow points right from "Tier 1" towards a rectangular box titled "supply sites".

2. **Supply Sites**:
   - A vertical rectangle is labeled "supply sites" at the top. Inside, it contains:
     - The number "25" at the top.
     - Three lines of percentages: "a global %", "b regional %", and "c local %" vertically listed.
   - An arrow extends rightward from the supply sites box to another oval labeled "RDCs".

3. **RDCs (Regional Distribution Centers)**:
   - On the far right, another vertical oval with a light gray fill is labeled "RDCs". Inside, it contains "50 + xx minor".

4. **Annotations**:
   - To the left of the supply sites rectangle, the following texts are listed in order:
     - "%COGS"
     - "p% raw"
     - "q% 1ry pack"
     - "r% 2rypack"
     - "s% others"
   - Two lines extend horizontally from the right side of the supply sites box. One line is labeled "Multiregional" and the other "Tactical".

Spatially, the diagram is organized with the tiers on the left, feeding into the supply sites, which in turn supply the RDCs on the right. The lines and arrows indicate flow and connections between the different sections.
