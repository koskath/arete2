The image depicts two rectangular, thin objects resembling RFID tags or electronic circuits, placed on a blue gradient background that becomes lighter toward the bottom. 

The object on the left is a rectangular frame with rounded corners. It consists of multiple concentric copper-colored metallic loops that form a rectangular spiral. In the top-left corner of this spiral is a small, integrated electronic component that appears to be connected to the loops via two metallic lines.

The object on the right has a similar structure but is slightly bent or curved toward the right. The metallic loops form a rectangular spiral, and a small electronic component is located near the top-middle of the spiral, connected to it with metallic lines.

Both objects have a transparent substrate or film backing, which is visible around the loops and electronic components. The background color is uniform without any additional features or text.
