The image is a green banner with white text and includes the following elements:

1. On the left side, there is the logo for the "ICC," which consists of large white uppercase letters: "ICC."
2. Below that, in smaller font, it reads "International Chamber of Commerce" in uppercase letters. 
3. Directly beneath "International Chamber of Commerce," in even smaller font, is the phrase "The world business organization" in lowercase letters.
4. To the right of the ICC logo and text, there appears the hashtag "#Incoterms."
5. Further to the right is an "@" symbol followed by "ICC_Incoterms."
6. At the far right of the banner is the URL "iccwbo.org/incoterms."

All text elements are aligned horizontally across the middle of the banner. There is even spacing between each section of text, and everything is set against a solid green background.
