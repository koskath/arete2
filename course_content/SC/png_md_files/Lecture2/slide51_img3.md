The image consists of three horizontal, parallel diagrams with labels and colored bars. 

1. **Left Side:**
   - There is a blue, stylized icon of a cargo ship located at the far left.

2. **Labels & Diagrams:**
   Each diagram is aligned vertically with three rows of bars labeled as "Risks," "Costs," and "Insurance."

   - **Top Section (FOB):**
     - Title: "Free On Board (...named port of shipment)"
     - Green bars for "Risks" and "Costs" extend halfway across the diagram to a vertical line, and navy blue bars continue from this point to the end.
     - "FOB" label is in blue on the right.

   - **Middle Section (CFR):**
     - Title: "Cost and Freight (...named port of destination)"
     - Green bar for "Risks" extends halfway across the diagram, while its navy blue counterpart starts from the halfway point and continues to the end.
     - Green "Costs" bar extends three-quarters across, continuing in navy blue afterward.
     - No bar for "Insurance."
     - "CFR" label is in blue on the right.

   - **Bottom Section (CIF):**
     - Title: "Cost, Insurance and Freight (...named port of destination)"
     - Green bar for "Risks" extends halfway across the diagram with a navy blue continuance.
     - Green "Costs" bar extends three-quarters of the way, followed by a navy blue section.
     - Green "Insurance" bar stretches across the entire span.
     - "CIF" label is in blue on the right.

3. **Lines & Separation:**
   - Vertical lines demarcate changes between bar colors within each diagram.
   - Each diagram is horizontally aligned with no intersections between the three sections.
