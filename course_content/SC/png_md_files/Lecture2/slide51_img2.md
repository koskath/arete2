The image contains a horizontal flowchart illustrating a supply chain in a schematic form. It is divided into three main segments labeled "Seller," "Cargo terminal" (appearing twice), "Customs" (also appearing twice), and "Buyer." 

At the top, a series of icons represent the stages and facilities involved:
- Starting on the left, three factory building icons symbolize the "Seller."
- A truck icon follows, indicating transportation.
- An icon resembling a terminal or railway cargo facility follows under the first "Cargo terminal" label.
- A warehouse icon is next, followed by a large crane structure, which relates to "Customs."
- Two cargo ship icons represent the ocean transport stage, situated between two large crane icons with a terminal structure. 
- Another warehouse is shown under the second "Customs" label.
- Subsequent icons include another terminal/railway facility under the second "Cargo terminal" and a truck.
- Finally, two building icons near the "Buyer" label signify the destination.

Below the icons, two horizontal bands represent "Risks" and "Costs":
- Both bands are light green from the "Seller" to the first "Customs" stage labeled "Free Alongside Ship (...named port of shipment)."
- The bands then turn dark blue from the first "Cargo terminal" to the end, under the second "Customs" label.

The abbreviation "FAS" is in large light blue text to the right of the horizontal bands, corresponding to "Free Alongside Ship." The overall image is cleanly divided by vertical lines, delineating each stage.
