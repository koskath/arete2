The image contains a segment of a stylized graphical text on a black background. The visible part shows thick, white, rounded lowercase letters that appear to be part of a continuous or cursive script. The visible letters are partially cut off, beginning on the left with what appears to be the bottom half of the letter 'q', followed by two identical shapes resembling the 'u', and ending with the right portion of a letter that is likely a 'd'. The thick stroke of these letters creates a bold, smooth appearance against the solid black background. No other objects, colors, or annotations are present.
