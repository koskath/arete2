The image contains a partial view of bold, white, lowercase letters with smooth, curved edges set against a solid black background. The letters visible are the end of a word, specifically "ow". The "o" is mostly visible with its entire oval shape on the left side of the image. The "w" follows directly after the "o", with only the right two-thirds visible, showing two upward curves that form the end of the letter. Each character has a thick, uniform stroke width. The top parts of the letters are cut off as they approach the edge of the image, suggesting the word continues beyond the visible area. The background remains consistently black throughout the visible area.
