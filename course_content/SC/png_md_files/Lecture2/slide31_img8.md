The image features a white, abstract shape against a solid black background. The shape consists of a series of distinct, curved, and smooth lines, each resembling elongated, rounded arches. The central section of the shape is notably thicker and curves from left to right, resembling a wavy line. There are five visible curves, each spaced evenly apart. The lines are consistent in thickness and maintain the same curvature throughout, creating a uniform pattern from left to right. The white and black contrast is stark, making the curved pattern prominent and easily distinguishable.
