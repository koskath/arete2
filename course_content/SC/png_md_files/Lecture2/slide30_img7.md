A woman is standing inside what appears to be a greenhouse, surrounded by a field of yellow flowers, likely gerberas. She is positioned slightly to the right of center, wearing a black t-shirt. Her left arm is resting on a white metal railing that horizontally spans across the image. The greenhouse is filled with rows of yellow gerbera flowers, with stems and large green leaves visible. The flowers are uniformly planted and appear to be at a similar height. In the background, a row of red flowers is visible, contrasting with the dominant yellow. The ceiling of the greenhouse consists of supports and translucent panels that allow light in. The overall setting is orderly, with a focus on the cultivation of flowers.
