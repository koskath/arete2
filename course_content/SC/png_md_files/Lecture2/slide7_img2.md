The image is a flowchart divided into three main horizontal sections labeled "Idea to Market," "Business Readiness," and "Order to Payment." Each section contains multiple processes represented by linear sequences of arrows and various labels.

1. **Idea to Market (Top Section):**
   - Enclosed in a rectangular box, this contains two horizontal arrow sequences:
     - "Research/ Development" has six arrows pointing right.
     - "Strategic Marketing" has six arrows pointing right.
   - A vertical gray bar labeled "Target" is on the right.

2. **Business Readiness (Middle Section):**
   - Enclosed in a larger rectangle, this section includes several horizontal and vertical sequences:
     - Left vertical label: "Ressources."
     - Horizontal processes include:
       - "Media-/ Salesforce Deployment" with a curved arrow sequence.
       - "Key Account" with six arrows.
       - "Sales Process" with a curved sequence ending in a half-circle.
   - A vertical gray bar on the right is labeled "Costumer."
   - A sequence labeled "Costumer Relationship Management Process" with various dashed connecting lines is below the arrow sequences.

3. **Order to Payment (Bottom Section):**
   - Enclosed in another rectangular box:
     - Left vertical label: "Vendors/ Suppliers."
     - Along the top row:
       - "Forecasting" has three green arrows.
       - "Production/ Distribution" has five blue arrows with a dashed arrow above pointing left to right.
     - Middle row:
       - "Warehousing" consists of five vertical, curved sequences.
     - Right side processes:
       - "Order-Entry" with four orange arrows.
       - "Order Fulfillment" with four red arrows.
     - "Payment-Flow" process with four pink arrows at the bottom.
   - A vertical gray bar labeled "Costumer/ Market" is on the right.

4. **Adaptation and Evolution (Bottom of Image):**
   - A small separate rectangular section labeled "Adaptation and Evolution" includes:
     - A sequence labeled "Controlling" with a vertical arrow to the right.
     - "Plans/ Budget" with two rows of arrows pointing right.

Arrows of various colors (green, blue, orange, red, pink) indicate directionality and flow, suggesting the interconnected processes and feedback loops typical in supply chain management. Curved arrows emphasize flow direction, and dashed lines show process interconnections.
