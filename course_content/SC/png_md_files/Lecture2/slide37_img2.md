Level: This section of the image is structured into four distinct levels. Each level has a corresponding number, description, schematic, and comments.

1. Level 1:
   - Number: 1
   - Description: "Top Level (Process Types)"
   - Schematic: A set of five grey process arrows arranged horizontally. They are labeled from left to right as: "Plan," "Source," "Make," "Deliver," and two additional arrows labeled "Return." Arrows point from "Plan" to "Return."
   - Comments: This level defines the scope and content for the Supply Chain Operations Reference-model. It is where the basis of competition performance targets are set.

2. Level 2:
   - Number: 2
   - Description: "Configuration Level (Process Categories)"
   - Schematic: Three dark grey arrows pointing right, overlaid by two lighter grey overlapping arrows, with the entire arrow set pointing to the right.
   - Comments: A company’s supply chain can be "configured-to-order" at this level from 30 core "process categories." Companies implement their operation strategy through the configuration they choose for their supply chain.

3. Level 3:
   - Number: 3
   - Description: "Process Element Level (Decompose Processes)"
   - Schematic: A darkly shaded rectangle containing smaller rectangular blocks labeled: 
     - "P1.1 Identify, Prioritize, and Aggregate Supply Chain Requirements"
     - "P1.2 Identify, Assess, and Aggregate Supply Chain Resources"
     - "P1.3 Balance Supply Chain Resources Against Supply Chain Requirements"
     - "P1.4 Establish and Communicate Supply Chain Plans"
     An arrow points down from the "Configuration Level" to this level. A magnifying glass icon is represented pointing towards these elements.
   - Comments: Level 3 defines a company’s ability to compete successfully in its chosen markets. It lists the following components: 
     - Process element definitions
     - Process element information inputs, and outputs
     - Process performance metrics
     - Best practices, where applicable
     - System capabilities required to support best practices
     - Systems/tools
   - It mentions that companies "fine tune" their Operations Strategy at Level 3.

4. Level 4:
   - Number: 4
   - Description: "Implementation Level (Decompose Process Elements)"
   - Schematic: A sequence of connected blocks forming a larger structure of flow-chart rectangles, suggesting a detailed decomposition.
   - Comments: Companies implement specific supply-chain management practices at this level. Level 4 defines practices to achieve competitive advantage and to adapt to changing business conditions.

Arrow Indicators:
- To the left of the levels, a large arrow labeled "Supply-Chain Operations Reference-model" points upwards from Level 4 to Level 1.
- Below Level 4, a smaller arrow labeled "Not in Scope" points downward.

Overall Layout:
- The image is organized in a tabular format with four columns labeled "Level," "#," "Description," "Schematic," and "Comments."
- Each level is represented in a separate row with respective specifics outlined in each column.
