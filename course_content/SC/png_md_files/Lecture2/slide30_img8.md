The image features the FedEx Express logo on a white background. The logo consists of the text "FedEx" in a bold, sans-serif font. The letters "Fed" are in purple, and "Ex" is in orange. Notably, the "E" and "x" in "Ex" form an arrow pointing to the right, created by the negative space between the two letters. Below "FedEx," the word "Express" is written in a smaller purple font, aligned to the right. There is a registered trademark symbol "®" in orange, positioned at the upper right corner of the letter "x" in "Ex." The overall alignment is centered and balanced.
