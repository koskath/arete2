The image features a geometric shape with a transparent and pale blue fill, resembling a trapezoidal prism or a three-dimensional parallelogram. It is oriented with the longer base on the bottom and a smaller base on top, tapering from left to right. 

Two thin vertical lines run from top to bottom within the shape, dividing it into three sections. The central line is located slightly left of center, and the leftmost vertical line is closer to the left edge.

On the far left, outside the blue shape, there is a black arrow pointing to the right. Above the arrow tip, the letter "Z" is written. This arrow is part of a larger "Z" shape or diagram with the arrow indicating direction along the bottom of the shape. 

On the extreme right, outside the shape, a vertical black line runs parallel to the right edge of the trapezoid. The line is vertically aligned with the blue shape but not touching it.
