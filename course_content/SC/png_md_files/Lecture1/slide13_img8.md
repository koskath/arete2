Below a bold turquoise heading with the words "LEAN WAREHOUSING," is the text "BY KEN ACKERMAN" in smaller black capital letters, followed by "Foreword by John Finn" in italicized text. Central to the image is a cartoon of a man depicted in black and white. He is holding up a square clipboard with his left hand, while his right hand manipulates three puppet-like figures attached to strings. The man is leaning slightly forward, concentrating on the puppets. The puppets are three smaller human figures, each with arms outstretched beside them, as though controlled by the strings. They are dressed in simple attire: short-sleeved shirts, pants, and hats. The figures appear to be walking together, casting shadows on the ground. Around the image is a thin black border with turquoise accents. The background is white, and the overall arrangement is centered and symmetrical.
