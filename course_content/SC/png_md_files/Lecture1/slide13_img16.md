The image shows a simplified supply chain logistic diagram with the following elements:

1. **Background and Layout**:
   - The background is a solid light blue color.
   - The image is horizontally divided into three main sections (left, center, right).

2. **Left Section**:
   - A green truck labeled "Transport, Inc." is on the left side. 
   - The truck has a cab with three visible wheels and a trailer with four visible wheels.
   - An oversized green arrow labeled "Inbound" points toward the center of the image, indicating entry into the middle section.

3. **Center Section**:
   - A beige warehouse-style building is depicted in the center.
   - Six stacks of boxes are shown in front of the building: three stacks on the ground level and three above them, aligned with the truck trailer.
   - Each stack contains grid-like patterns indicating multiple boxes piled on top of each other.
   - The building's base has a gray rectangular platform.

4. **Right Section**:
   - An orange van is on the right edge of the image with two visible wheels.
   - Four large green arrows labeled "Outbound" are on the right side, indicating exit or distribution moving away from the building.
   - The arrows are aligned horizontally, parallel to each other, pointing from left to right (center to edge).

The spatial relationship shows the truck entering with goods in the left section, storage or processing in the center section (warehouse), and distribution or delivery in the right section using the van and outbound arrows.
