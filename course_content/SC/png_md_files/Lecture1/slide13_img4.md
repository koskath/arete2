The image shows an airport scene at night featuring a large cargo airplane with the front nose section raised, revealing the cargo loading area. The airplane is white with a blue stripe and the words "CARGO" and "Airlines" visible on the side. A logo is partially seen on the nose section. Three individuals are standing on the tarmac observing the operation; one is wearing a yellow hard hat and green safety vest, while the other two wear formal attire. 

A mobile cargo loading platform is parked at the nose of the plane, with a worker or operator near it. The background is mostly dark, indicating it is nighttime. The ground beneath is marked with yellow lines indicating pathways or parking areas. Additionally, a small white vehicle is moving near the loading platform, appearing slightly blurred due to motion, with two individuals visible on board. To the right, some cargo is covered in red wrapping, sitting on the tarmac.
