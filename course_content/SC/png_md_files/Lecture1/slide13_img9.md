The image depicts a flexible roller conveyor system set against a gradient background transitioning from bright yellow at the top to black at the bottom. The conveyor features a series of skate wheels aligned in multiple parallel rows, visible as small round black components. These wheels are connected by cross-braced metal supports that form a zigzag pattern, creating a diamond-shaped accordion framework along the length of the conveyor.

The entire conveyor is arched in an S-shaped curve, extending from the foreground to the background. It is supported by four vertical adjustable legs each fitted with casters for mobility; two legs are visible in the foreground and two in the background. The casters are cylindrical, with a grey hue, and allow for easy movement. The cross-braced supports are primarily silver, contrasting with the black wheels and support legs. There are colored tags or labels on some of the diagonal supports, visible in blue and yellow shades. No additional annotations, markings, or labels are present in the image.
