The image shows a 3D rectangular shape that is tilted, resembling an elongated box. The box has a light blue tint with two visible parallel diagonal lines running from the top to the bottom on the left and right sides. 

- The left side of the box has a vertical gradient line, darker at the edge.
- The right side of the box is a trapezoidal face, outlined by a grey line.
- At the front left corner next to the side edge, a thick black arrow points leftward, made of two overlapping triangles.
- At the bottom right corner, inside the lighter grey trapezoidal face, the letter "Z" is written in black, italicized font.
- The entire shape appears to be shaded to indicate dimensionality, with the lighter part facing upwards.

There are no other notable features, annotations, or visible data points in the image.
