The image contains a diagram of a trapezoidal shape with a light blue fill. The shape is oriented horizontally with the longest parallel side on the bottom. The left side slopes upward to the right, forming a parallelogram-like shape on the left, with the top and bottom edges connected by a slanted line from the top-left to bottom-right. There is a large black arrow on the left side pointing horizontally to the right, with the arrow's tail adjacent to the left vertical edge of the trapezoidal shape. The top-right corner of the shape has a small, black arrow pointing to the right. The trapezoidal shape is outlined with a black border. The image lacks any annotations, text, or additional markings.
