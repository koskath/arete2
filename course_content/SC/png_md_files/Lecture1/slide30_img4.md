The image features a portion of a large cargo ship prominently displaying a section stacked with numerous shipping containers. The lower part of the ship includes a visible hull painted in dark blue, displaying the name "SEA-LAND MISTRAL" in large, white capital letters, with the word "BREMEN" below it. Several oval-shaped openings are visible along this section of the hull, likely functioning as air vents or windows.

Stacked above the hull are several rows of multicolored shipping containers, arranged in a tightly packed grid. The containers are aligned in distinct horizontal and vertical rows, forming a structured wall-like appearance. They feature a variety of colors, including gray, red, blue, and a few others, with different company logos and markings visible on their surfaces. Some containers have noticeable numbers and letters, possibly identification codes. 

Several crisscrossing ropes or cables extend diagonally across the image from the left side, some appearing taut while others have slight slack. There is a small visible section of an adjacent structure on the left side of the image, possibly part of another vessel or a dock, done in a darker tone which partially overlaps the array of containers.
