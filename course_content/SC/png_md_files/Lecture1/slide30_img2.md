The image depicts a diagrammatic illustration of a supply chain process involving a service provider and a recipient. On the left side, there is a stylized truck shown in a simplified, outline form. The truck's back is open, revealing several stacks of boxes or pallets inside. In front of the truck, two stacks of what appear to be pallets are placed. The word "Dienstleister" is written underneath in bold, white text.

An arrow, pointing from left to right, connects the elements on the left with a set of shelves on the right. The arrow is filled with small, evenly spaced dots and has a large triangular arrowhead.

On the right side, multiple shelving units are depicted, filled with various box shapes, representing stored items. These shelves are shown in a similar simplified outline style. The word "Empfänger" is written underneath in bold, white text.

The entire image uses a monochromatic color scheme, and the elements are drawn primarily with white lines and text against a black background.
