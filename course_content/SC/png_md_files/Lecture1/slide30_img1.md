The black-and-white image features a hand-drawn illustration of two primary structures labeled "MTV-Anbieter" and "Absender." 

On the left side, the "MTV-Anbieter" part contains two connected rectangular buildings. The building on the left has two floors, each with a row of three windows featuring angled shading lines. The second building is taller, with three floors and matching window styles. In front of this building group, there are four cuboid shapes, resembling stacked product boxes or containers, aligned in a row.

Moving to the right, the "Absender" section includes a building drawn in a perspective view. It consists of part of a tall structure at the back and a longer, rectangular building extending forward. This structure displays rows of windows with diagonal shading lines on three visible floors. In front of this, multiple stacks of products or containers are visible, drawn with grid-like patterns indicating their contents.

Between these two regions, a large arrow is positioned horizontally, pointing from "MTV-Anbieter" to "Absender," signifying a directional flow or process. At both ends of the image, there are smaller white triangular shapes facing inward.

The background is black, enhancing the contrast between the white illustrations and text.
