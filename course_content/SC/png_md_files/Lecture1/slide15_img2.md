The image contains a block of text with two distinct sections: 

1. **Left Section:**
   - Text is vertically aligned and reads: 
     - "Logistics Adds Value to Products"
   - The words are stacked one above the other with "Logistics Adds" on top and "Value to Products" directly below.

2. **Right Section:**
   - The text is horizontally aligned and consists of several sentences:
     - "Management is quite concerned with the 'value added' by logistics, because improvements in place and time utility are ultimately reflected in the firm's profits. Cost savings in logistics or a stronger marketing position due to an improved logistics system can both cause improved bottom line performance. In firms where logistics contributes a significant portion of the 'value added' to a product, logistics management is particularly important. Figure 1-3 illustrates that importance in several industries."

The overall layout positions the vertical text on the left, with the horizontal paragraph adjacent to it on the right. The background appears black with white text. There are no additional graphics, annotations, or spatial dividers present in the image.
