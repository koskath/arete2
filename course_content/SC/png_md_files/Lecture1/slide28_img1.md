The image shows a detailed layout on a dark blue background with various dotted outlines resembling pieces of clothing or a garment pattern design. Central to the design is a red, angular shape with curved edges, displaying the text "LEVI'S" in uppercase white letters. This red shape is prominently placed over the central part of the layout, which might represent the upper part or torso of the garment.

Surrounding this central element are several sections outlined with dotted lines, indicative of different segments of the clothing pattern. They include:

1. Two large symmetrical sections on either side of the central area, extending outward and slightly curved, possibly representing sleeves or side pieces of the garment.
2. Additional smaller shapes within these larger sections, each outlined with dotted lines, possibly indicating details or stitching areas.
3. At the bottom half of the layout, beneath the central red shape, there are several smaller, irregular polygonal shapes also enclosed in dotted lines, suggesting various parts such as pockets or design details.
4. Smaller details within the central vertical section also appear, with dotted lines forming short, horizontal, rectangular shapes, bisected by a central dotted line running vertically, which might suggest buttons or plackets.

In the top right corner and extending downward along the side is a vertically oriented sequence of numerical combinations separated by brackets. The numbers appear in white and seem to represent coordinates, measurements, or product codes, although their specific function is not defined within this context. 

Overall, the design suggests a technical or industrial layout, specifically one related to garment manufacturing, showcasing various pattern pieces necessary for creating a specific article of clothing.
