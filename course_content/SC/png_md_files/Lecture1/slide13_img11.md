The image features a person standing on the right side, wearing a dark blue coverall. They are using both hands to place a rectangular, light gray storage bin with a lid onto a stack of similar bins. There are two columns of bins on a wheeled platform or dolly. The column on the left consists of eight identical, stacked light gray bins with lids. The column on the right has six bins stacked, with the individual adding one more bin on top, making it the seventh in that column. Each bin has a stepped design on the sides, with visible rims and handles for easy stacking and handling. The dolly underneath the bins is dark and has four wheels visible, providing mobility to the structure. The background is plain and white, with no additional elements visible.
