The image shows a blue plastic container with raised edges and several structural reinforcements along the sides and corners. The container is open at the top and positioned against a white background. Inside the container rests a black platform or tray elevated by several small pegs or supports from the container's bottom. 

On top of the black tray, there are multiple identical white objects symmetrically arranged in a grid-like pattern. The objects are cylindrical and tiered, resembling small discs stacked successively with smaller diameters as they ascend, forming a stepped design. There are approximately four rows, each containing multiple columns, suggesting an orderly arrangement.

The left side of the blue container shows a detailed edge with small protrusions, possibly used for locking or stacking. On the right side of the container, there is a white label affixed with printed text, which is partially obscured but includes some alphanumeric characters. To the right of the label, a small black object is attached to the outside of the container, potentially a clip or locking mechanism.

In the upper left corner of the image, black text is printed over the background. The text is in a smaller font size and lines up in a list format, but the content is not legible. Above the blue container, there are no additional structures or objects visible. The entire image is bordered by a thin line.
