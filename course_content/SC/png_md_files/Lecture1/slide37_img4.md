The image depicts a horizontally positioned arrow with a thick, blue, semi-transparent shaft. The arrow is pointing to the left, with a black triangular arrowhead. The left side of the arrowhead is sharp, indicating the direction. The tail end at the right is the widest and features a 90-degree inward cut, resulting in a rectangular section on the right edge. The arrow gradually narrows as it moves from right to left. The background is white, and no additional annotations, text, or elements are present.
