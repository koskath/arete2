The image is a book cover with a combination of imagery related to logistics and supply chain management. 

At the top, there are names aligned horizontally in uppercase letters: "JOHN MANGAN | CHANDRA LALWANI | AGUSTINA CALATAYUD." Below this, the background shows a scenic landscape with rolling green hills and wind turbines, five of which are visible. The sky above is partly cloudy with a subdued, pastel-like color gradient of purples and oranges, suggesting a sunrise or sunset.

Below the landscape, the central text is presented in large, bold white uppercase letters: "GLOBAL LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT." Underneath this main title, in smaller white uppercase letters, it says: "FOURTH EDITION."

In the lower half, the background shifts to an industrial scene. There is a stack of colorful shipping containers, predominantly in reds, blues, and oranges, on the left. To the right, a large delivery drone carries a cardboard box with a barcode and is hovering above one of the stacks of containers. Below the drone, several white delivery trucks are lined up in front of the containers, facing outward.

In the center of the industrial scene, there is an airplane flying directly towards the viewer, with its wings level and engines visible, positioned against a cloudy sky that has a gradient of darker and lighter clouds.

In the bottom right corner, the publisher's name "WILEY" is printed in white uppercase letters. The overall composition integrates elements representing different facets of global logistics, including air transport, land vehicles, and automated delivery systems.
