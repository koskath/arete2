The image features an irregular hexagon with a horizontal alignment. The shape appears to be a trapezoid with an additional small triangle on the left side. The hexagon is outlined in black and filled with a light blue color. There are three vertical lines subdividing the hexagon into four distinct sections. The smallest section is on the far left, created by a diagonal rising line from left to right, starting from the bottom left. The other three sections are rectangular. 

An arrow is located above the leftmost triangle, pointing left. The arrow is black, and originates from a black base situated inside the triangle. The surrounding space outside the shape is white. There are no additional annotations, text, or markings on the image.
