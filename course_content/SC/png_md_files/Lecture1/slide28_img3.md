The image consists of two main sections:

1. **Left Section:**
   - A female figure is standing, facing forward.
   - The individual is wearing a white two-piece outfit consisting of a top and bottom, resembling a bikini or undergarments.
   - She is standing on a white platform or floor with a light background, possibly a studio or a controlled environment.
   - The figure's posture is upright with arms relaxed by her sides.
   - The lighting is even, with minimal shadows.

2. **Right Section:**
   - A computer monitor displays digital imagery and text.
   - The screen is divided into two main parts side by side:
     - The left part shows a silhouette of a human figure from the front, matching the standing woman's pose.
     - The right part shows a side view of the same silhouette.
   - Below the silhouettes is a rectangular section with text boxes and labels.
     - The section is labeled with three tabs or buttons with labels that are not completely legible.
   - The interface resembles software for body measurement or visualization, labeled with text primarily in German.
   - The screen display is dominated by shades of gray and blue, with the silhouettes being darker and the background lighter.

3. **Additional Details:**
   - The monitor is of an older style with a thick frame.
   - Below the monitor, part of a caption is visible, containing German text likely related to the use of computers in measurement.

4. **Overall Context:**
   - The setting appears to be a blend of technology and human modeling, suggesting a theme of digital body analysis or clothing fitting systems.
