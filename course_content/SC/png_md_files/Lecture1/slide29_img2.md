The image displays a computer tower viewed at an angle showing the front and one side. The case is primarily blue with a black side panel. 

On the front panel, at the top right corner, there is the brand name “XPS” in white text. Below the logo, the front panel has a convex, metallic, kidney-shaped button or disc positioned centrally within a recessed, vertical capsule-shaped area. The disc appears reflective, with a central protrusion, possibly a power button or design feature. 

The side panel features the word “DELL” in large, white, uppercase letters. The side panel is otherwise unadorned, showing the smooth black surface and slightly curved edges.

The tower has gently rounded top edges, and there is a visible seam where the front panel meets the side panel. The overall design of the tower has a modern, sleek aesthetic accentuated by its two-tone color scheme and minimalistic branding.
