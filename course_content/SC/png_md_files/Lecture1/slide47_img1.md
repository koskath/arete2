The image depicts a stylized cover of a book titled "Global Logistics and Supply Chain Management, 3rd Edition." The background features a panoramic view of a small, exaggeratedly spherical earth. 

At the top of the sphere, there is a blue sky with scattered clouds and an airplane flying to the left, above a city skyline. The city has several high-rise buildings with modern architecture on the right side.

In the center of the sphere is a green, grassy area, with a winding gray road crossing through it horizontally. On the road, two trucks are moving toward each other; the one on the left is red, and the one on the right is gray.

Surrounding the grassy area is a curving coastline with white sandy beaches. Beyond the beaches, there is a strip of blue ocean. 

On the ocean, near the bottom center of the sphere, there is a large cargo ship. The ship's deck is visible and is loaded with multiple colorful containers.
