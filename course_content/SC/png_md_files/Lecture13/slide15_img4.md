The image contains a segment of two overlapping ellipses. 

1. **Ellipses:**
   - The larger part of the image shows an olive-green ellipse occupying the right side. This ellipse contains the text "Electronic Catalogue" in bold, dark letters. The text is centered within the ellipse.
   - The left side of the image shows a partial view of a light blue ellipse. Only a sliver of this ellipse is visible. 

2. **Overlap and Boundaries:**
   - The ellipses are intersecting, with a thin black curved line demarcating the boundary between them. The overlap area is shaded in a muted, slightly greenish tone.
   - The visible part of the light blue ellipse extends slightly into the olive-green ellipse, showing an intersection.

3. **Text Elements:**
   - The text "Electronic Catalogue" is positioned horizontally within the olive-green ellipse. It has consistent and aligned typography.

4. **Additional Textual Elements:**
   - On the extreme lower right, there is a partial view of the letter 'V' and top of 'M' in black, possibly indicating another word or label which is cut off by the image's edge.
   - On the extreme left edge, part of the letter 's' is visible, implying the presence of additional text that is mostly cropped out.

The overall composition provides a visual intersection of two entities, possibly representing interconnected categories or topics.
