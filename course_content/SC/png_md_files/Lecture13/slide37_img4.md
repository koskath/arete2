The image features a diagram with several elements. On the left side, there is a cylinder annotated with the text "Input" inside a small oval shape at its tip. This leads into a larger, horizontally-aligned cylinder representing a process, labeled "Bestand in der Fertigung" inside it. The background of this central cylinder is textured with a series of horizontal wavy lines.

On the right side of this cylinder is another small oval shape labeled "Output." This whole structure is outlined in black.

Connected to the "Output" is a stylized, abstract figure. The figure is in a pulling stance, depicted in blue. The figure consists of a circle for the head, a pentagonal shape for the torso, and angular geometric shapes for the arms and legs. The arms stretch and connect to the output point of the cylinder, emphasizing a pulling action.

The diagram's elements are clear with distinct black outlines around each shape. The central cylinder with the "Bestand in der Fertigung" text appears highlighted with a dotted square surrounding it, indicating a point of focus.
