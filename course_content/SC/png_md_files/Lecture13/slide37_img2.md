The image is a flowchart diagram consisting of seven vertical columns, each representing a distinct production strategy. The columns are composed of rectangular boxes arranged vertically, each connected by downward-pointing arrows. The rectangles are labeled to denote stages in a production process. 

1. **Left Column (Processing without order):**
   - Sequence of boxes: 
     - "Design"
     - ↓ "Purchasing"
     - ↓ "Fabrication"
     - ↓ "Assembly"
     - ↓ "Packaging"
     - ↓ "Distribution"

2. **Second Column (Shipment to order):**
   - Sequence of boxes: 
     - "Design"
     - ↓ "Purchasing"
     - ↓ "Fabrication"
     - ↓ "Assembly"
     - ↓ "Packaging"
     - ↓ "Distribution"

3. **Third Column (Packaging/labeling to order):**
   - Sequence of boxes: 
     - "Design"
     - ↓ "Purchasing"
     - ↓ "Fabrication"
     - ↓ "Assembly"
     - ↓ "Packaging"
     - ↓ "Distribution"
   - Broken dashed line box extends from "Packaging" to "Distribution"

4. **Fourth Column (Assembly to order):**
   - Sequence of boxes: 
     - "Design"
     - ↓ "Purchasing"
     - ↓ "Fabrication"
     - ↓ "Assembly"
     - ↓ "Packaging"
     - ↓ "Distribution"
   - Broken dashed line box extends from "Assembly" to "Distribution"

5. **Fifth Column (Fabrication to order):**
   - Sequence of boxes: 
     - "Design"
     - ↓ "Purchasing"
     - ↓ "Fabrication"
     - ↓ "Assembly"
     - ↓ "Packaging"
     - ↓ "Distribution"
   - Broken dashed line box extends from "Fabrication" to "Distribution"

6. **Sixth Column (Purchasing to order):**
   - Sequence of boxes: 
     - "Design"
     - ↓ "Purchasing"
     - ↓ "Fabrication"
     - ↓ "Assembly"
     - ↓ "Packaging"
     - ↓ "Distribution"
   - Broken dashed line box extends from "Purchasing" to "Distribution"

7. **Right Column (Engineering to order):**
   - Sequence of boxes: 
     - "Design"
     - ↓ "Purchasing"
     - ↓ "Fabrication"
     - ↓ "Assembly"
     - ↓ "Packaging"
     - ↓ "Distribution"
   - Broken dashed line box includes all stages

**Annotations and Text:**
- Left-hand side: "STANDARDIZATION" running vertically.
- Right-hand side: "CUSTOMIZATION" running vertically.
- Bottom annotations for each column:
  - First column: "Pure standardization"
  - Second column: "Segmented standardization"
  - Third column: "Customized standardization"
  - Fourth column: "Tailored customization"
  - Fifth column: "Tailored customization"
  - Sixth column: "Tailored customization"
  - Seventh column: "Pure customization"
- Bottom arrow running horizontally from left to right, labeled "anticipative speculation" on the left, transitioning through a gradient to "reactive postponement" on the right.
