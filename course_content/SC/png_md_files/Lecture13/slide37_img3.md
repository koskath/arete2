The image features a stylized, simplified representation of a person in blue. The person is depicted as a geometric figure with a circular head, triangular feet, and a triangular body leaning forward, arms outstretched to the right. The left hand is shown as a small triangle touching a rectangular object labeled "Input" in beige.

Connected to the "Input" rectangle is a larger beige oval with the label "Bestand in der Fertigung." An arrow pointing right is at the left side of the oval, facing the person. There is a dashed ellipse surrounding the oval, suggesting some kind of flow or movement.

On the right side of the oval, there is an arrowhead within the oval, and another smaller rectangle labeled "Output," which extends further to the right. This suggests a directional flow from "Input" through "Bestand in der Fertigung" to "Output." The oval itself contains dashed, curved lines, which create a pattern inside the shape.

The spatial arrangement illustrates a flow from left to right, starting from the person’s hands, moving through the entire sequence of elements.
