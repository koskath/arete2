A rectangular shape with beveled edges fills the entire frame. The rectangle has a soft, light yellow color. Its surface gives the appearance of being slightly reflective or glossy, due to the gradient shading which creates a sense of depth and dimension. The outer edges of the rectangle have a subtle transition from light to slightly darker yellow, enhancing the beveled effect, while the center area retains a consistent light yellow tone. There are no additional markings, text, or distinguishing features present within or around the rectangle.
