The image consists of a yellow oval shape occupying most of the central area. Inside this oval, there is bold, dark gray text that reads "Vendor Managed Inventory," arranged in three separate lines. The word "Vendor" is on the first line, "Managed" is on the second line, and "Inventory" is on the third line, with each word centered within the oval. In the top left corner of the image, there is a smaller partially visible shape resembling a segment of a circle, filled with a pale yellow color and outlined with a black curve. This smaller shape overlaps the larger oval slightly.
