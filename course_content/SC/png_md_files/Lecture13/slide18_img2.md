The image features a circular diagram with four concentric circles, divided into eight equal radial sectors by lines emanating from the center. These sectors and circles create a radar or spider chart design.

Starting from the top and moving clockwise, the sectors are labeled as follows:
1. "Responsibilities" - top vertical line.
2. "Demarcation lines" 
3. "Stock points" 
4. "Shared resources" - horizontal line to the right.
5. "Modularity" 
6. "Planning possibility" 
7. "Configurability" - bottom vertical line.
8. "Decoupling points" 
9. "Interfaces" 
10. "Info, infrastructure" - horizontal line to the left.
11. "Tasks" 
12. "Functions" 

Within this circular diagram, the sectors corresponding to "Modularity," "Planning possibility," and "Configurability" are filled with a yellow color and collectively labeled as "Product structure" in a highlighted yellow rectangular box at the bottom right outside the circle.

Additionally, there are three separate boxes positioned around the circle:
- "Logistic organization" is positioned diagonally up and to the left of the circle.
- "Basic structure" is directly above the yellow box, to the upper right of the circle.
- "Control structure" is positioned diagonally down and to the left of the circle.

The circular sections are divided by four circles of increasing diameter, indicating a hierarchical or layered structure, each separated by equidistant concentric lines. Arrows in each section radiating outward from the center indicate directionality.
