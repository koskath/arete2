The image is a section of a map depicting parts of a railway network overlaid on a blue-shaded geographical area likely representing a region with water bodies. 

1. **Background and Base Map:**
   - The main area is shaded light blue, suggesting bodies of water or a specific zone.
   - Several white lines outline the boundaries and contours of countries or regions, which appear to be part of East Asia.

2. **Railway Network:**
   - Two main railway corridors are illustrated.
   - The first is a green dashed line labeled "MANCHURIAN." Dashes are small rectangles in green, evenly spaced, indicating a railway path. This line runs diagonally from the northwest to the southeast, moving south around the center, then curving eastward to an endpoint.
   - The second is a red solid line starting at the northeast end, running parallel to the coast towards the southeast border of the map section.

3. **Cities and Points of Interest:**
   - Several blue dots surrounded by white circles denote cities:
     - "MANCHURIAN" is directly north with a blue dot and lines leading off.
     - "HARBIN" is slightly southeast within the center of the map area.
     - "SHENYANG" is further southeast.
     - "ERLIANHOT," "TIANJIN," "DALIAN (JINGANG)," and "QINGDAO (JINZHOUH)" are along the southern line or near the bottom-left corner.

4. **Labels and Annotations:**
   - Text labels are in bold capital letters for city names, with some appearing in a second script below the English name.
   - "HARBIN" is featured in both English and another script (possibly Chinese).
   - There is a decorative script-like red marking in the bottom right, ending with a small red dot.
   - On the right border, text is oriented vertically: "Railway Container Transport (2)."

5. **Geographical Awareness:**
   - The map features a coastline which the red railway line follows.
   - The landmass seems to curve into a peninsular formation at the bottom, where other network lines and city markers cluster.

Overall, the map fragment is part of a larger network illustration, showing existing and proposed transport routes across the indicated region.
