The image depicts a flowchart with various labeled boxes and arrows. 

1. At the top center is a box labeled "Forwarder (Agent)." Two curved arrows originate from this box. One arrow points to the "Container shipping line" box, and the other points to the "Shipper or consignee" box, indicating a contractual relationship.

2. Below "Forwarder (Agent)" are two overlapping shaded ellipses. The left ellipse is labeled "Port," and the right ellipse is labeled "Hinterland."

3. Within the "Port" ellipse, there are three horizontally aligned boxes:
   - On the left, "Container shipping line."
   - In the center, "Container stevedore."
   - On the right, partially overlapping with the "Hinterland" ellipse, "Trucking company."

4. Below the "Port" ellipse, there are three vertically aligned boxes:
   - "Customs" is aligned directly below "Container shipping line."
   - "Port authority" is directly below "Container stevedore."
   - "Inspection" is directly below "Trucking company."

5. To the right, within the "Hinterland" ellipse, is the "Shipper or consignee" box.

6. Solid arrows indicate container flow:
   - A rightward arrow connects "Container shipping line" to "Container stevedore."
   - Another rightward arrow connects "Container stevedore" to "Trucking company."
   - A final rightward arrow connects "Trucking company" to "Shipper or consignee."

7. Vertical lines indicating relationships:
   - A vertical line connects "Container shipping line" to "Customs."
   - Another vertical line connects "Container stevedore" to "Port authority."
   - A third vertical line connects "Trucking company" to "Inspection."

8. In the bottom right is a legend with symbols:
   - A rectangular outline labeled "Actor."
   - A rightward arrow labeled "Container flow."
   - A double-headed line labeled "Contract."

Each box and arrow is precisely labeled to indicate specific actors and the direction of flows.
