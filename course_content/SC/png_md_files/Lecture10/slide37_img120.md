The image contains a series of vertical, parallel lines on the left side, predominantly dark blue with some lighter blue shading, appearing closely spaced together. The lines are vertical and evenly spaced, forming a stripe pattern against a white background. To the right, there is a visible part of a single, large, diagonal line that starts vertically at the top and shifts to a slight diagonal towards the bottom-right corner, also in shades of blue with some gradient effect. The background is uniformly white across the entire image. The rightmost section of the image appears to have a fragment of a blue, possibly curved or angled shape partly visible against the white background.
