The image is a vertical timeline chart that details the evolution of container ship sizes in terms of TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) capacity from 1968 to 2006. Each year on the timeline is annotated with a silhouette of a container ship, its name, and its TEU capacity.

- **1968**: Smallest ship silhouette, "Encounter Bay," capacity listed as 1,530 TEU. 
- **1972**: Larger silhouette than 1968, "Hamburg Express," capacity of 2,950 TEU.
- **1980**: Similar size increase, "Neptune Garnet," capacity of 4,100 TEU.
- **1984**: Slightly larger, "American New York," with a capacity of 4,600 TEU.
- **1996**: Noticeable increase in size, "Regina Maersk," with a capacity of 6,400 TEU.

The ships are shown as flat silhouettes with hulls depicted in brown and cargo symbolized by stacked yellow rectangles. Each ship silhouette escalates in size as the timeline progresses, representing the increase in container capacity over the years. The names and capacities are aligned horizontally to the right of each ship silhouette.
