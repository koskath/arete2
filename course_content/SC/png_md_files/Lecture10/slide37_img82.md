The image contains two main sections: 

1. On the left side, there are numerous narrow vertical lines. These lines are predominantly neutral tones, likely consisting of shades of gray with a thinner blue line overlayed across them at an angle. The lines are closely spaced together, creating an impression of a dense cluster.

2. On the right side, there are thicker vertical blue lines with greater separation. These lines contrast with the background and are spaced at regular intervals. 

Additionally, there is a horizontal element at the top of the image that is part of a larger, light blue shape extending across the top portion of both sections. 

Partial text is visible, with the letters "TRA" in the upper middle right, although it's fragmented and incomplete. The background is primarily white.
