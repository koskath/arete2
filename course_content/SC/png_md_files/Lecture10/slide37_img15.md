The image is composed of vertical bands of varying colors across the entire width. From left to right, the bands transition through shades of blue, green, gray, brown, and bright blue. The bands are narrow and of different widths, featuring a smooth gradient-like blend between colors. The transition between each color band is seamless, creating a visually continuous effect. The overall appearance is abstract, with no discernible shapes or forms apart from the vertical stripes. There is a very thin, almost imperceptible, white border around the image.
