The image is divided into two main sections. The upper section is titled with three categories: "Current combinations," "European MC," and "Other possible MCs." 

1. **Current combinations:**
   - **First Row:** Labeled "Tractor A semitrailer." Features an image of a tractor unit connected to a single semitrailer.
   - **Second Row:** Labeled "Truck with drawbar trailer." Shows a truck followed by a drawbar trailer.

2. **European MC:**
   - **First Row:** Labeled "Tractor A B-double." Shows a tractor unit pulling a two-segment B-double trailer.
   - **Second Row:** Labeled "Truck with C-dolly and semitrailer." Displays a truck connected to a dolly, which is connected to a semitrailer.

3. **Other possible MCs:**
   - **First Row:** Labeled "Tractor A semitrailer with fixed dolly and semitrailer." Features a tractor pulling a semitrailer, a fixed dolly, and another semitrailer.
   - **Second Row:** Labeled "Truck A semitrailer with dolly and another semitrailer." Depicts a truck pulling a semitrailer, followed by a dolly and another semitrailer.

The lower section is separated by a horizontal line and includes three diagrams illustrating different trailer configurations. 

1. **First Configuration (left):**
   - Four trailers labeled A, B, C, D are aligned horizontally.
   - An arrow points right, indicating a combination of the four units.

2. **Second Configuration (middle):**
   - The trailers labeled A, B, C, D are stacked vertically, indicating an assembly.
   - A large arrow points right to a wagon configuration.

3. **Third Configuration (right):**
   - It includes a single semitrailer labeled 3 and two trailers labeled 2, positioned to suggest a coupling process.
   - There is a "plus" sign and an angled arrow pointing right, suggesting a reconfiguration.

The bottom-left part of this section has a circular structure suggesting a coupling distribution mechanism. No additional labels or annotations are visible in these diagrams.

All diagrams are simple black and white line drawings, and all vehicles are presented from a side view.
