The image depicts three different boxes, each with dimensional annotations indicated by dashed arrows. 

1. **Left Box:**
   - A standard rectangular box with closed flaps on top.
   - The box has brown tape crossing the top, forming an "X" pattern.
   - Two dashed arrows on the face of the box indicate dimensions:
     - Vertical arrow labeled "H" for height.
     - Horizontal arrow labeled "W" for width.
   - On the side face, a horizontal dashed arrow is labeled "L" for length.
   - There are also printed symbols on the side: an umbrella symbol and two vertical arrows indicating "Keep Dry" and "This Side Up."

2. **Center Box:**
   - A more rounded, bulging box resembling a squished cube.
   - Brown tape is applied across the top and side, almost horizontally.
   - A dashed arrow, formed around the curved edge, is labeled "L."
   - A vertical dashed arrow on the side is labeled "H."
   - Another horizontal dashed arrow is labeled "W."
   - Similar symbols as the first box are visible on the side.

3. **Right Box:**
   - An irregularly shaped box with a stepped appearance, featuring an indentation.
   - Brown tape runs diagonally across the top of the visible larger face.
   - A dashed arrow from the base to the top edge is labeled "H" for height.
   - A horizontal dashed arrow on the lower section is labeled "L."
   - A horizontal dashed arrow on the larger side face is labeled "W."
   - No symbols or graphics are present on this box.

All boxes are illustrated on a reflective surface with a slight shadow beneath each. The background is a plain gradient from white to light gray.
