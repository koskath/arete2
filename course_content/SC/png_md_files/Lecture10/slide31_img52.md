The image consists of two large, bold, black capital letters on a white background. The letters are "L" on the left and "P" on the right. The "L" is a simple right-angled shape with a vertical and a horizontal stroke meeting at a 90-degree angle. The "P" has a vertical stroke on the left and a semicircular bowl on the right. The letters are closely spaced but not touching, and they appear to be of a sans-serif typeface. There are no other visible elements, markings, or annotations in the image.
