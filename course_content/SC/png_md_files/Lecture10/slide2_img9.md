The image consists of multiple vertical stripes of varying colors, arranged closely together across the entire width. The colors progress from left to right, starting with dark greys, greens, and black stripes, followed by lighter shades of green and grey. As the progression continues, the stripes shift to beige, and then a prominent royal blue stripe appears towards the center-right. To the right of the blue stripe, a series of darker colors resumes, including dark brown, black, and deep grey hues. The stripes are smooth and consistently sized, creating a continuous gradient of colors across the image. There are no other structures, annotations, or elements present within the image.
