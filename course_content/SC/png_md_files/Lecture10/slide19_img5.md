The image contains a mixture of printed text, a diagram, and handwritten annotations in red. 

1. **Printed Text:**
   - At the top, there's a bullet point followed by the text: "Investment cost required to produce the inventory to fill the pipeline."

2. **Diagram:**
   - On the left, a vertical list with three horizontal sections labeled as follows:
     - "Booking in system" with a gray shaded rectangle containing the number "3."
     - "Arrival store USA" with a white rectangle containing the number "3" beneath it.
     - "Arrival port" with a pattern-shaded rectangle containing the number "14."
   - To the right of this list, several dashed horizontal lines indicating different sections.
   - At the far right, there is a vertical rectangle, outlined, with the number "18" at the top and "1" at the bottom inside it.

3. **Labels:**
   - To the left of the boxes, there are labels in parentheses:
     - "(D)" next to the "Booking in system" box.
     - "(C)" next to the "Arrival port" box.

4. **Handwritten Annotations:**
   - On the left side, the word "USA" is written in red.
   - Two curved arrows starting from the "Arrival store USA" area, pointing upward and to the right towards the rectangle labeled "18."
   - On the right side, above the vertical rectangle, there's additional red handwriting that appears to be words, possibly "Port" and "On site," though they aren't entirely clear.
   - A large red oval encircles portions of the diagram, emphasizing or highlighting parts of it.

5. **Spatial Relationships:**
   - The diagram is aligned horizontally, with spatial separations marked by dashed lines.
   - Numerical values inside the boxes vary from "1" to "18," indicating different amounts or units, possibly related to the supply chain process.

This detailed depiction provides a sense of structure indicative of a logistical or supply chain process, with elements possibly representing flow stages or inventory amounts.
