The image depicts a cross-sectional side view of a waterfront container terminal with detailed structures and annotations:

1. **Ship and Water:**
   - On the far left, a large white container ship with a red hull is shown partially moored at the quay. 
   - It's filled with green stacked containers, arranged in a rectangular grid.
   - The ship is docked in water, shaded blue, with gentle waves depicted on the water's surface.
   - A control tower or smokestack featuring black and white stripes is visible on the top left of the ship.

2. **Quay Crane:**
   - Adjacent to the ship, a large gray quay crane stands over the quay.
   - The crane features a lattice structure with triangular bracing and is supported by A-frame legs.
   - It has a prominent circular pulley system.
   - A horizontal boom extends over the ship, and a large rectangular spreader beam is suspended to lift containers.
   
3. **Trucks and Containers on Quay:**
   - Various crane motorway trucks are depicted on the quay, each towing a chassis carrying green containers.
   - Six trucks are visible, positioned in a line along the quay with another truck just beneath the crane's spreader.

4. **Yard Cranes and Containers:**
   - Three red gantry yard cranes are arranged sequentially from left to right.
   - Each crane is labeled with "40 T" indicating a 40-ton capacity.
   - The first and second cranes are lifting green containers.
   - Containers are stacked in tightly packed blocks underneath the cranes.

5. **Ground and Lower Structure:**
   - The ground level is marked with a black, bold horizontal line indicating the separation between the quay and containers stacked underground or in a storage facility.
   - Green containers are displayed in two vertical-six horizontals arranged in a grid beneath the surface.

6. **Spatial Relationships:**
   - The quay with the ship and the crane is positioned to the left, transitioning into the container yard with gantry cranes and trucks, moving towards the right.
   - The cranes and trucks create a visually synchronized workflow representation across the ground level, emphasizing the linear transfer of containers.

Each component and aspect of this image is arranged to portray a complex but orderly logistic operation at a container terminal.
