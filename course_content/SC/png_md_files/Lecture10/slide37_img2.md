The image contains an array of vertical lines primarily concentrated on the left side. These lines vary in shades of blue and are tightly packed together. Their lengths differ, forming a dense pattern against a white background. In the middle to lower right section of the image, there is blurred text that appears to read “COPENHAGEN BV,” though the letters are not entirely clear. A diagonal blue line extends from the top right towards the middle of the image. The overall composition is visually dominated by these blue elements against the white space.
