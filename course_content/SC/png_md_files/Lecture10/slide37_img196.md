The image consists of a series of vertical stripes, each of varying colors, widths, and intensity, running from the top to the bottom of the image. On the left side, the stripes predominantly feature shades of green, gray, and muted yellow with some narrow dark stripes interspersed. As the image progresses towards the right, the colors transition through various shades of gray and blue, with a bright, solid blue stripe being distinctly prominent and wider than the others. Toward the far right, the stripes include darker tones, primarily black and dark brown, mixed with faded gray. There is no apparent texture or additional markings on these stripes; they are solid and continuous throughout the image. The background remains completely filled with these vertical stripes, without any overlapping or interruptions.
