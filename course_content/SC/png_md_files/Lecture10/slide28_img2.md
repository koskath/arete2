The image shows a section of a graph with a white background. There are three evenly spaced horizontal gray lines running parallel across the image. The graph consists of vertical blue bars of varying heights distributed along the horizontal axis. The blue bars are grouped closely together with some gaps. Intersecting the blue bars is a red line graph that varies in height, often exceeding the height of the blue bars. The red line starts near the bottom left, curves upward and downward in a wave-like pattern, and includes sharp peaks and troughs. There are several handwritten red lines and an arrow pointing upwards in the center. No labels, titles, or numerical values are present in the visible section of the image.
