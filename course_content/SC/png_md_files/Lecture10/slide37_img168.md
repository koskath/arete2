The image consists of a series of vertical colored lines varying in thickness. The left section contains a high concentration of thin vertical stripes in a variety of dark shades, including black, dark brown, dark purple, and dark blue hues. As these stripes progress to the right, they gradually transition into thicker vertical bands of blue. 

The transition area between the two sections has mixed shades where colors from both sections blend slightly, creating some intermediate tones. The right section of the image is dominated by a solid block of bright blue, making up a significant portion, which is the most consistent and uniform area compared to the left side.

The entire composition seems to have hard edges, with no gradients or soft transitions between lines, maintaining a clear and sharp distinction between each color. The visual design is strictly linear, with no horizontal elements or annotations present. The position goes from dark and varied on the left to bright and consistent towards the right.
