The image contains two large uppercase letters, "P" and "L," in bold, black font against a white background. 

1. The letter "P" is on the left side. It consists of a vertical rectangular stem on the left and a semicircular curve at the top right that extends from the upper part of the stem, creating an enclosed rounded space at the top right of the letter. 

2. The letter "L" is on the right side. It consists of a vertical rectangular stem on the left side and a horizontal rectangular base on the bottom, forming a right angle between the two components.

Both letters are aligned horizontally, occupying approximately equal space with a small gap between them. The overall visual impression is balanced and stark due to the boldness of the font. The simplicity of the shapes and the use of black against white create a high-contrast and clear design.
