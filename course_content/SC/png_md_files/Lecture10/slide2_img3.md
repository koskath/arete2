The image consists of a series of vertical, blurred color bands arranged from left to right. The bands vary in width and color. Starting from the left, the colors include dark green, blackish green, olive green, lighter green, and shades of gray. There is then a transition through light beige and light blue. In the central part of the image, a vivid blue band is present, which is wider than the surrounding colors. Following the blue, there is a narrow white vertical stripe containing partial, blurred text that seems to read "GPS." To the right of this, there is a gradient transition from blue to brown, with the shades blending softly into each other. The edges of each band are slightly blurred, contributing to a streaked appearance across the entire image.
