The image contains a flowchart with several rectangular nodes connected by directed arrows. Each node has a label inside, and some are connected with blue and red arrows, indicating different flows or types of relationships. 

- **Nodes:**
  - The top-left node labeled "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)" is connected with both red and blue arrows.
  - Below it to the left is a node labeled "Exporter, Shipper."
  - Directly below "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)" is a node labeled "Trucker."
  - To the right of "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)" is a node labeled "Ocean Carrier."
  - Below and to the center is a node labeled "Railway Terminal."
  - Below "Railway Terminal" is another node labeled "Inland Container Depot."
  - To the right of "Railway Terminal" is a node labeled "Railway Operator."
  - Far right, there are two vertically stacked nodes: 
    - The upper node is labeled "Terminal at Seaport."
    - The lower node is labeled "Container Depot at Seaport."

- **Arrows:**
  - Red arrows:
    - One originates from "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)" to "Ocean Carrier."
    - Another from "Trucker" to "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)."
    - One from "Exporter, Shipper" points to "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)." 
  - Blue arrows:
    - Two arrows originate from "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)" to "Railway Terminal."
    - One from "Railway Terminal" to "Railway Operator."
    - An arrow from "Railway Operator" loops back to "Railway Terminal."
    - An arrow from "Railway Operator" to "Terminal at Seaport."
    - One from "Terminal at Seaport" points to "Container Depot at Seaport."
    - An arrow loops from "Container Depot at Seaport" back to "Terminal at Seaport."
    - An arrow from "Container Depot at Seaport" points back to "Ocean Carrier."
    - A blue arrow from "Inland Container Depot" loops back to "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)."

The design reflects a network or process flow, illustrating relationships and interactions among different entities or roles involved.
