The image shows a three-dimensional visual representation of a classic film clapperboard. The clapperboard is primarily gray and features diagonal black and white stripes on the clapper stick. The base of the clapperboard has an engraved, stylized text that reads "Movies." Below this clapperboard, there is a red and white rectangle resembling a "YouTube" play button icon, indicating the word "Gone" in red on the white portion to resemble a notification or modification. The entire design appears to be an icon or logo. The perspective is slightly tilted upwards and to the right, giving a sense of depth and three-dimensionality.
