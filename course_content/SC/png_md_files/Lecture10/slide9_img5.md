The image is divided into two sections by a horizontal black line. The upper section is a white background with three text labels. On the left, it says "Pre-Carriage" in bold black font. Centrally, it reads "Main Haul by By Sea, Inland Navigation or Railway" also in bold black font. On the right, it states "Onward Carriage," again in bold black font.

The lower section illustrates a simplified transport scenario. On the left, there is a red truck with a white cabin and two yellow rectangular cargo containers on its back. The truck has six black wheels visible. 

In the center, there is a blue cargo ship with a simple design, featuring two inclined black ramps on either side directing towards the ship. On the ship's deck are two red trucks, identical in appearance to the left truck, each carrying two yellow containers. The ship has three visible white circles on its side, representing windows.

On the right, there is another red truck, similar to the one on the left, with two yellow cargo containers. This truck also has six visible black wheels and is oriented to the right, suggesting forward movement. 

The overall composition suggests a flow of transport from left to right, starting with the truck on land, loading onto the ship, and continuing again with the truck on land.
