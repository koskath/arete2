The image shows a block of text with a diagonal red "X" superimposed over it. The text is rendered in a serif font, with the lines slightly angled upwards from left to right. The visible portion of the text includes phrases related to freight forwarding and logistics services, including references to carriage, storage, handling, advisory services, and insurance. The red "X" consists of two intersecting lines, each stretching from one corner of the image to the opposite corner, effectively crossing out the text. The text is partially obscured by the red lines, which are bold and prominent. The background is white, providing a contrast to the black text and red lines.
