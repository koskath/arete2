The image is a graph with two axes. The vertical axis is labeled "Rate per kilo" and the horizontal axis is labeled "Consignment weight." The graph depicts a downward-curving line that starts from a higher point on the vertical axis and decreases gradually as it extends to the right along the horizontal axis. The line illustrates an inverse relationship between the rate per kilo and consignment weight, showing a decrease in rate per kilo as consignment weight increases. The curve starts steep and levels off as it moves rightward, indicating diminishing decreases in rate. The axes meet at a right angle in the bottom left corner of the graph.
