The image consists of a barcode pattern on the right side, with multiple vertical black and white lines of varying thicknesses alternating. The barcode appears crisp and well-defined. On the left side, a triangular shape with a gradient color filling from white to blue is visible. The triangle's base is aligned vertically parallel to the barcode lines. The blue portion of the triangle is intense, occupying the right edge and blending into white as it moves left. The barcode's and triangle's lower edges are slightly angled downwards towards the right. The background is white, enhancing the contrast between the barcode and triangular element.
