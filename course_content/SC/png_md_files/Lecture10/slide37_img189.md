The image consists of several vertical stripes of varying colors and thicknesses. From left to right:

1. A thin stripe of light grayish-green.
2. A thicker dark blue stripe.
3. A thinner gray stripe.
4. A light beige vertical area with a slightly wavy boundary on the right side.
5. Another medium-sized stripe, predominantly dark with hints of green.
6. Thin stripes in a mix of blue and black hues.
7. A sequence of very thin stripes consisting of alternating dark blue and black, blending into each other.
8. A prominent large vertical area on the right side of the image, filled with a solid, bright blue color.

These stripes, varying in width, run parallel to each other and occupy the entire height of the image. The transitions between the colors are mostly sharp except for the wavy boundary noted earlier.
