The image contains a sequence of vertical, elongated triangular shapes placed side by side. Each shape is a different color and features a gradient that transitions from a darker shade at the thicker base to a lighter shade at the narrower peak. From left to right, the shapes and their respective colors are:

1. A black triangle with a smooth transition to gray.
2. A medium gray triangle with no distinct gradient.
3. A blue triangle with a light base transitioning to a darker peak.
4. A blue triangle similar to the previous one but slightly overlapping it.
5. A wider blue triangle with a smoother gradient from medium blue at the base to darker blue at the peak.
6. A narrow blue triangle that is more subtle in its gradient.
7. A portion of another shape to the far right, not entirely visible.

All shapes are set against a white background, and the edges of the shapes are clean and distinct. There are no annotations or additional markings in this image.
