The image shows a partial view of a structure that includes elements resembling a barcode on the right side. This consists of multiple vertical black lines of varying thickness and spacing on a white background. On the left side, there is a large blue shape with a gradient effect, transitioning from a lighter blue on the left edge to a deeper blue towards the right. The blue shape forms an uneven, diagonal boundary against the white background. Visible on the far right is a partially visible word, part of which reads "CENTRAL" in bold, dark blue or black lettering, partially obscured. The letters are slanted slightly to the right, in an italic style. Parts of these elements are cropped out of the image.
