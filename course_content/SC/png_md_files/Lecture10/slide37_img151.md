The image is divided into two main sections. The left section consists of numerous vertical lines in varying shades of blue, ranging from light to dark. These lines are tightly packed together, creating a striped pattern. The color palette within these stripes includes blacks, dark blues, purples, and a few lighter blues, giving a gradient effect. The right section of the image features a solid, deep blue color that occupies about one-third of the total width. The transition between the two sections is abrupt, with the striped pattern directly abutting the solid blue area. The overall composition shows a stark contrast between the intricate striped left side and the uniform right side. There are no annotations, text, or additional elements present in the image.
