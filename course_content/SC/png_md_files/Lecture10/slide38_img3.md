The image is a detailed technical drawing of a structural assembly, possibly a container or a box-like structure, shown in various cross-sections with dimensions and specifications. The main sections are labeled "SECTION A-A" and "SECTION B-B," both at a scale of 1:10. The drawing includes precise measurements and annotations throughout.

### Section A-A
- At the top left corner, there are measurements for the door opening height, labeled as "DOOR OPENING HEIGHT 2280.0" with a label beneath it indicating "4-GUSSETS t4.0" and a measurement of "t4.0".
- There are multiple horizontal lines with varying thickness labeled with their respective thickness, such as t3.0, t2.0, and t1.6.
- A vertical measurement for "INTERNAL LENGTH 5900.0" is displayed centrally.
- The bottom portion of Section A-A shows intricate gusset details: labeled "3-GUSSETS t4.0" with a measurement of "t4.0" and an angle detail of "45".
- The bottom left shows more layered detail, including a measurement of "t3.5" and an annotation "4 GUSSETS", indicating more components.
- The bottom indicates "100X50Xt3.2 R.H.S.", detailing the material or section profile used.

### Section B-B
- Shows measurements under "CAMBER 5mm" and "60X60Xt3.0 Q.H.S." near the top.
- The "INTERNAL WIDTH 2352-5" label is shown with a dimension bar below it from left to right.
- A vertical arrangement at the right side with arrows pointing upwards labeled as "2-φ10 LASHING BARS" with measurements "30 30 36 4".
- The cross-section includes structural lines with marks t3.0, t4.0, t3.5, indicating various thickness or component profiles.

### Right Panel
- Contains a table listing dimensions, capacity, weight, and other specifications divided into "EXTERNAL," "INTERNAL," and "DOOR OPENING".
- The table columns have labeled "LENGTH," "WIDTH," "HEIGHT," with details convertible into feet/inches and metric units (mm).
- Additional rows indicate specifications like "MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT," "TARE WEIGHT," "MAXIMUM PAYLOAD" given in kilograms.
- Box section at bottom right called "CLASSIFICATION," includes "FRONT ASSEMBLY," "SIDE ASSEMBLY," labeled as "R/ht1 L/ht1." 
- Other boxes contain fields for "DRAWING NO.," "DESCRIPTION," "REMARK," and initials at the bottom right corner with "CHECKED" and "DRAWN" labels.

### Other Elements
- Scattered throughout are arrows, dimension indicators, and construction details for structural reinforcement and positioning.
- Several measurements have direct annotations such as "36," "30," "50," referencing millimeter dimensions across components.

This drawing comprehensively details structural and functional members, ensuring accuracy of dimensions and material specifications necessary for construction or manufacturing processes.
