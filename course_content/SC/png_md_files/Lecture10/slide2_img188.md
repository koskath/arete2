The image consists of a series of vertical stripes that span the entire height of the image. The stripes vary in color, width, and saturation. From left to right:

1. A very narrow stripe of light blue.
2. A sequence of narrow stripes that transition from beige to various shades of gray and black, interspersed with muted green tones.
3. A slightly wider vertical band of muted blue with subtle variations in shade.
4. A prominent, wide vertical area dominated by a rich, deep blue color, which occupies nearly half of the image's total width.
5. The background is white on both the extreme left and right sides.

The colors transition smoothly from one to the next without any abrupt changes or interruptions. The overall composition gives a gradient-like effect, with a heavier emphasis on blues towards the right.
