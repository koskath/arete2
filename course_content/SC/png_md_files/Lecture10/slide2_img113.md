The image consists of a white background with two distinct blue lines. The first line appears on the left side of the image and is vertical, with a slight taper toward the top. The second line is on the right side, oriented diagonally from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. It is wider and exhibits a consistent thickness throughout. Both lines are shaded with a gradient from light blue to a darker blue towards the center of each line. The area outside the two lines remains entirely white and unmarked.
