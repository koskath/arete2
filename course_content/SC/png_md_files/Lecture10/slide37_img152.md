The image features a vertically oriented gradient and pattern. On the left side, there is a series of thin, closely spaced vertical lines that transition in color. The colors in these lines range from dark blue to lighter blue and gray hues. These lines create a blended effect as they progress horizontally towards the right. The right side of the image consists of a solid, vibrant blue section, which takes up about one-third of the image's width. This section is sharply demarcated from the patterned area by a straight vertical edge. The overall appearance transitions from a complex, multicolored pattern on the left to a uniform blue surface on the right.
