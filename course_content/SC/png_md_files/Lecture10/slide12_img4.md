The image shows a three-dimensional, isometric drawing of a rectangular container, often used in air transport. The main elements are:

1. **Rectangular Structure**:
   - The container has a rectangular cuboid shape with a slightly sloped bottom, tapering inward, forming a trapezoid shape along the bottom edges.

2. **Labels and Text**:
   - On the front panel of the container, the text "AKE2345" is prominently displayed near the top in bold letters.
   - Below and to the left of the main text on the front panel, the label "AKE" is located in smaller font.

3. **Dimensions**:
   - On the right side of the image, a double-headed arrow indicates the height of the container with the label "64 in."
   - On the bottom, a double-headed arrow shows the width dimension labeled as "79 in."
   - Another arrow at the bottom, slightly to the left, shows another width dimension as "60.4 in."

4. **Panels and Surfaces**:
   - The surfaces of the container are shown with gradient shading to indicate dimensional perspective.
   - A black rectangle, possibly indicating a handle or a structural feature, is located centrally on the front panel.

5. **Lines and Arrows**:
   - Solid lines define the edges of the container, while dashed lines are used for measurement indicators.
   - Measurement arrows are annotated with arrows at both ends, showing specific dimensions.

Overall, the container is illustrated with clear labeling and precise dimension annotations, suitable for understanding its size and shape in a logistical context.
