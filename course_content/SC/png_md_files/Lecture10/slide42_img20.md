The image contains a section of a diagram with three rectangular shapes with rounded corners, labeled respectively "Trucker," "Container Depot," and "Depot at Seaport." 

- The rectangle labeled "Trucker" is on the left. 
- The rectangle labeled "Container Depot" is to the right of "Trucker." An underlined word "Depot" is present, with a red "X" marked over the word, intersecting lines crossing it out.
- The rectangle labeled "Depot at Seaport" is on the far right. There is a red "X" over the word "Seaport," and a visual emphasis is added with a thick red stroke under the word, forming an upward curve and then descending into a scribble or loop pattern overlapping the bottom of the rectangle.

There are curved, freeform lines connecting the rectangles:
- A blue curved line extends from "Trucker" to "Container Depot."
- A red curved line begins at "Trucker," loops downwards, and connects to "Depot at Seaport." This red line is intertwined with a blue line that extends from "Trucker" and curves directly into "Container Depot" before weaving through and moving towards "Depot at Seaport."

The diagram includes only these elements on a white background, creating a simple flow with connections between the boxes using both red and blue lines.
