The image contains a series of vertical, parallel bands stretching from the top to the bottom. Each band varies in color and width, creating a striped pattern across the image. On the left side, the bands are predominantly shades of dark green, black, and gray. Towards the center, the bands transition to lighter hues, including pale greens and off-whites. A prominent, bright blue band is located slightly to the right of center, standing out against the more muted colors surrounding it. To the right of the blue band, there are narrower bands of various colors, including brown, gray, and a hint of purplish hues. The overall effect is a gradient from dark to light, then to bright and mixed colors on the right. The bands are evenly spaced without gaps, creating a continuous flowing pattern.
