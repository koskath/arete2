The image contains a structured diagram composed of multiple sections with labels, boxes, lines, and arrows. The top part consists of a series of boxes with text, each separated by vertical lines. The boxes are labeled:

1. "Versandort/ Ladestelle"
2. "Vorlauf" with sub-labels listed as:
   - "per LKW"
   - "per Bahn"
   - "per Bischi"
   - "per Kombi"
3. "Ladehafen" with sub-labels listed as:
   - "Kai"
   - "Kai-schuppen"
   - "Packing-Center CFS"
4. "Seetransport Port to Port"
5. "Löschhafen" with sub-labels listed as:
   - "Kai"
   - "Kai-schuppen"
   - "Packing-Center CFS"
6. "Nachlauf" with sub-labels listed as:
   - "per LKW"
   - "per Bahn"
   - "per Bischi"
   - "per Kombi"
7. "Zielort/ Entladestelle"

Below the boxes, a central horizontal label reads, "konventionelle Seetransporte."

Under this, several horizontal arrows are depicted in parallel lines:

- The top five arrows extend from left to right without interruption. These arrows are segmented by repeated short dashes.
- The next line displays a continuous arrow from left to right, interrupted midway by a box labeled "Container." The arrow resumes with the label "LCL/LCL CFS/CFS" and continues rightward to another box labeled "Container."
- Below this, another line features a continuous arrow from left to right, similarly interrupted by a box labeled "Container" and annotated with "LCL/FCL CFS/CY." This is followed by a label "Container-Terminal Container Yard."
- The final pair of lines consists of uninterrupted arrows running parallel to the previous lines, extending from left to right.

The overall structure emphasizes a flow from "Versandort/ Ladestelle" on the left to "Zielort/ Entladestelle" on the right, segmented through various stages and annotations within the transportation process.
