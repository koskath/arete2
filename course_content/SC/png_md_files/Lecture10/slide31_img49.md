The image consists of two bold, black capital letters on a white background. The letters are "C" and "P". The letter "C" is on the left side and is an open circular shape, facing towards "P" with its open end. The letter "P" is on the right side and is a vertical line that curves into a semicircle on the upper right side, forming a loop. Both letters are of the same size and font style, with a consistent thickness in their strokes. The spacing between the two letters is moderate, with enough room to distinguish them individually. There are no additional elements, annotations, or colors present in the image.
