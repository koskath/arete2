The image presents a line graph with two distinct lines. At the top left corner, there is a label "2015 = 100". The vertical axis, although not labeled, is marked with horizontal dashed lines at 100, 110, 120, 130, and 140, with these values indicated to the left of the dashed lines.

The graph features two lines:

1. A blue line with notable sharp peaks and valleys, indicating high variability. The line generally trends upwards over time, starting around the 100-mark and reaching above 130 by the end of the graph.

2. A red line, which runs alongside the blue line but shows less volatility. This line also trends upward, starting near 100 and reaching a point just below 130 towards the end.

Both lines start at the bottom of the graph and rise towards the top with various fluctuations and intersections between them. The lines continue beyond the right edge of the visible graph area, indicating a continuation of data.
