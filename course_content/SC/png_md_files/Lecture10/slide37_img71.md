The image contains a blurred section of text and lines. The text is positioned diagonally, slanting downward from left to right. It is in a faded blue color and partially visible, making it indistinct and difficult to read fully. The larger visible text includes the words "COPENHAGEN" and "MANAGEMENT." To the left of the words, there is a logo with an incomplete circular shape and illegible symbols or letters enclosed within it. Vertical blue lines of varying thickness run down the left side of the text, blending into the white background. The lines appear continuous and evenly spaced, contributing to the blurred effect. There are no additional structures or annotations visible.
