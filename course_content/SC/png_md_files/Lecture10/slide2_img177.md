The image contains a series of vertical stripes that cover the entire width. The left side of the image features a dense collection of narrow, closely packed stripes in various shades of blue and gray. These stripes are interspersed with occasional hints of other colors such as green and beige. Moving to the right, the stripes transition into a solid, uniform blue area. This blue section comprises the majority of the right side of the image, providing a stark contrast to the more varied and textured pattern on the left. The overall effect is a gradual shift from a complex pattern to a simple, solid color. There are no annotations, labels, or text present. The edges of the image are aligned with the vertical direction of the stripes.
