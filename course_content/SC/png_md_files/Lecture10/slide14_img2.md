The image depicts a shipping and loading area with various elements related to container handling and transport.

1. **Ship:**
   - On the left side is a partial view of a large ship in water, characterized by a red and white hull.
   - The ship has a stack of green containers on its deck, arranged in a grid pattern, 5 containers wide and 4 levels high.

2. **Cranes and Equipment:**
   - A large, grey, overhead gantry crane spans across the image. It has a triangular truss structure on top and vertical support beams.
   - A large pulley wheel is visible on the left side of the crane’s horizontal beam.
   - The crane reaches over the containers on the ship and extends over the docks.
   - Two red mobile cranes with extendable arms are positioned on the dock. One crane is lifting a green container.

3. **Dock:**
   - The dock is grey and positioned above the water level. It has a black line running across the top edge.
   - Along the dock, there is a series of five small red vehicles, which appear to be transport vehicles or loaders.
   - One vehicle carries a single green container.

4. **Containers on Dock:**
   - Multiple stacks of green containers are arranged on the dock. 
   - On the right side, containers are stacked in two separate formations: one with 2 containers wide and 3 containers high, and another with 3 containers wide and 3 containers high.

5. **Water:**
   - Below the dock, the water is depicted in shades of blue and turquoise.

6. **Miscellaneous:**
   - There is a truck on the dock near the stacked containers, facing right.
   - White space is present above and below the dock area, likely representing the sky and water respectively.

The image illustrates the process of loading and unloading containers using cranes and vehicles between a ship and dock.
