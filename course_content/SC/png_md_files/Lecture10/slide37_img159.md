The image consists of vertical color bands. On the left, there is a sequence of thin vertical stripes with varying colors, including shades of black, gray, blue, and green. These stripes are closely packed together, displaying subtle variations in tone. As we move towards the center and to the right, the stripes become predominantly dark blue, transitioning into a large, solid block of dark blue occupying the right half of the image. This solid blue area has no variations or additional patterns. There is a narrow white border visible on the left and right edges of the image. The overall composition moves from a multicolored striped pattern on the left to a uniform dark blue on the right.
