The image contains a narrow, vertical section of a blue and white gradient object that appears to extend diagonally across the frame. The left side has a straight, partially visible vertical line, which suggests the presence of an edge. The top and bottom parts are not fully visible. The gradient transitions smoothly from a darker blue on the left edge to a lighter blue, then white as it moves to the right. There are no other discernible shapes, annotations, or details visible in this section.
