The image shows a three-dimensional illustration of a rectangular cargo container with several measurements and annotations. The container has a grid-like pattern on the side facing right, divided into multiple square panels. The top of the container features parallel lines that suggest a series of panels or divisions. 

On the left side of the container, there appears to be a design element that includes a stylized image that resembles an airplane outline and the word "cargo" written underneath it. 

There are arrows indicating dimensions on three sides of the container:
1. On the top side of the container, an arrow runs horizontally from left to right, labeled with "406.4 cm (160")."
2. On the left side of the container, another horizontal arrow runs along the bottom edge and is labeled "243.8 cm (96")."
3. Along the vertical side on the right, an arrow is shown extending from top to bottom, labeled "162.5 cm (64")."
4. The bottom length running from left to right of the image along the side is marked with an arrow and labeled "317.5 cm (125")."

These dimensions and labels outline the physical measurements of the cargo container, indicating its length, width, and height.
