The image contains a section of a diagram with text annotations and arrows. There is a series of horizontal lines, including a horizontal dashed line running parallel to two solid arrows labeled with different texts. 

In the top section, the text "Empty run" is positioned to the left, next to a left-pointing arrow labeled "in Carriers Haulage." Below this, another horizontal arrow, labeled "Full run," points to the right. This arrow is associated with the text "in Merchants Haulage." Both arrows are within a framework of dashed lines, indicating a specific segment or section.

The entire section is encircled by a bold red irregular oval shape that encloses all the elements described. 

Additionally, there is a partial text "Source" visible in the bottom right corner, outside the red oval, suggesting that the illustration is part of a larger document or diagram.
