The image is a rectangular graphic composed of vertical stripes of varying widths and colors. On the left side, there are multiple narrow, closely placed stripes that transition smoothly from very dark blue, through shades of gray-blue, to very light gray. As the eye moves from left to right, these stripes become progressively more saturated and darker in blue tones. The right side of the image features a significantly wider vertical stripe, which is a deep, saturated blue. There is a thin white border visible on the right edge, separating the blue stripe from the edge of the image. The overall effect is one of a gradient transition from complex, varied colors on the left to a uniform, rich blue on the right.
