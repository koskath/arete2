The image consists of elongated vertical stripes that stretch across the frame. The stripes vary in color, including shades of green, gray, blue, and brown. The colors are interspersed without a regular pattern and have a shiny, reflective appearance, suggesting a highly stylized, distorted representation of possibly metallic or glass surfaces. On the left edge, there is a thin vertical blue line. Towards the middle, there are prominent dark and vibrant blue stripes juxtaposed against the lighter tones. Throughout the image, the distribution of colors creates a sense of depth and texture, shifting smoothly from one hue to the next, with some stripes appearing more pronounced than others. The bottom and top of the stripes are not visible, indicating that they extend beyond the frame.
