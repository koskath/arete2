The image features a series of vertical lines on a white background. On the left side, some lines are thicker and appear in shades of light gray, with a slight blue tint on the edges. These lines are slightly curved and diagonal, slanting slightly towards the right. As you move to the right, there are several dark blue, vertical and parallel lines that are consistently spaced and straight. Among these dark blue lines, some lines appear thinner and very light in color, creating a pattern of alternating line thickness. In the top right corner, partially visible, is a text in bold, dark blue capital letters partially reading "IME". Some parts of the text are cut off from view. The background is entirely white, and there are no other visible elements or annotations in the image.
