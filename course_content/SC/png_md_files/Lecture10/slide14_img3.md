The image depicts a cross-section of a port setting with various equipment and elements structured horizontally and vertically. 

On the left, a large crane is visible, characterized by a wide horizontal arm extending over a body of water, illustrated with wavy blue and red lines. Underneath the crane's arm, a ship is seen docked, with a stack of five vertically aligned green rectangular containers on its deck.

Adjacent to the ship and crane, a red gantry crane straddles the ground, possessing a rectangular frame with four legs. It holds a green container underneath its central cross-beam. 

To the right, a tall red structure resembling a portal crane with the brand "Kalmar" on its beam is shown, featuring diagonal and vertical supports forming a rigid framework. This crane is hoisting a green container beneath it, with additional green containers stacked nearby.

At the bottom right corner, a flatbed truck is depicted, also positioned on the surface, facing right. The truck’s platform is empty, and it appears ready for loading.

Below the surface, a subterranean view displays what seem to be three stacks of green rectangular containers arranged sideways, illustrating storage or possibly underground facilities.

The illustration uses various colors to distinguish different elements: grey for cranes and structures, red for specific cranes and their components, green for containers, black for outlines, and blue for water. The ground is portrayed as a thick black line, separating the surface elements from the subsurface view.
