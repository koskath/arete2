The image is a simple gradient background transitioning from a light blue at the bottom to white at the top. The gradient is smooth and evenly distributed vertically across the entire image, without any additional details, structures, shapes, annotations, or spatial features. There are no distinct elements or objects present; the entire background is uniform in its gradient style.
