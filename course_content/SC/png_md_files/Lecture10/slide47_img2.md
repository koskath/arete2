The image is a complex flowchart depicting interactions between various entities involved in shipping and logistics. It includes a mix of rectangular boxes, oval shapes, arrows, and dashed lines. The components and connections are as follows:

1. **Central Elements:**
   - "Forwarder (Agent)" at the top center, connected with a bidirectional dashed arrow with:
     - "Port" (left side) and "Hinterland" (right side).
   - "Rail operator" directly below "Forwarder (Agent)" with:
     - A left-pointing arrow labeled "Container flow" from "Rail operator" to "Railway company."
   - "Infra supplier" in a horizontal rectangle at the lower section, connected with dashed lines to multiple elements above.

2. **Port Area:**
   - A shaded oval labeled "Port" on the left contains:
     - "Container shipping line" with a right-pointing "Container flow" arrow to "Container stevedore."
     - "Container stevedore" linked to "Terminal operator" with a right-pointing "Container flow" arrow.
     - "Terminal operator" connects upwards with "Forwarder (Agent)" with a curved dashed line.
     - Three vertical arrows labeled "Contract" from "Customs," "Port authority," and "Inspection" pointing to "Terminal operator."

3. **Hinterland Area:**
   - A shaded oval labeled "Hinterland" on the right contains:
     - "Railway company" linked by a right-pointing "Container flow" arrow to "Terminal operator."
     - "Terminal operator" linked to "Road haulage" with a right-pointing "Container flow" arrow.
     - "Road haulage" connects to "Shipper consignee" with a right-pointing "Container flow" arrow.
     - "Terminal operator" is linked upwards with "Forwarder (Agent)" via curved dashed arrows.

4. **Legend:**
   - Located at the bottom of the image, it explains the symbols:
     - Solid rectangles indicate "Actor."
     - Straight arrows indicate "Container flow."
     - Double-ended dashed arrows indicate "Contract."

The entire diagram is a comprehensive representation of the relationships and logistics flow between various shipping and supply chain actors within the specified regions of "Port" and "Hinterland."
