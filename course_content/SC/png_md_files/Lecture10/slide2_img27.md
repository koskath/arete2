The image is a vertical, abstract composition characterized by a predominant pattern of vertical lines and a gradient of colors. On the left side, there is a clear white vertical stripe, which narrows slightly as it extends downwards. Adjacent to this stripe, there are a series of tightly packed, vertical color bands. These bands include shades of grey, brown, blue, and a faint touch of red and green. The colors are blended together and appear to have a fuzzy, blurred quality. The overall effect is that of a streaked surface with a tapering white margin on the left, giving an impression of motion or smearing in the vertical direction.
