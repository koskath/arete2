A tall, narrow, metallic structure with a slightly reflective surface, resembling a pole or column, centered vertically. Its surface shows a pattern of alternating light and dark vertical stripes of varying opacity, giving a sense of depth and texture. The background is entirely white, providing contrast and emphasizing the shape. The bottom part has a visually compressed and slightly curved set of lines, suggesting the base or connection point of the structure. No other elements, annotations, or text are present.
