The image contains a section of text with handwritten red annotations. The text reads:

"Lead times are closely related to decisions on transport mode.

A valuable strategy is accounting logistics costs on a full-cost basis.

• Freight, insurance and handling costs
• Inventory carrying costs for products in transit and cycle stock
• Inventory carrying costs for safety stock"

The annotations include:

1. A red circle with a scribble inside it, drawn around the bullet point "• Freight, insurance and handling costs."
2. A red underline starting from the "A" of "A valuable strategy" and extending through almost the entire line ending at "full-cost basis."
3. A red underline beneath "handling costs."
4. Another red line loops around the bullet point "• Inventory carrying costs for safety stock."
5. Short red underlines and arrows are visible in various locations, emphasizing certain lines and points.
