The image consists of a rectangular shape with a gradient of colors predominantly in shades of blue. On the left side, there is a narrow band containing vertical lines. These lines exhibit a spectrum from light to dark blue with some greenish and purplish hues interspersed. To the right of this band, the colors transition into a broader area with a deeper and more uniform shade of royal blue. The edges of the image are bordered in whitespace, giving a clean demarcation of the blue gradients against the pale background. There are no visible annotations, text, or additional structures present within this image.
