The image consists of vertically oriented, multicolored stripes that vary in width. Starting from the left, there are narrow stripes in muted shades of browns and olive greens, transitioning into slightly wider stripes in grayish tones. The pattern continues with varying hues of gray, then shifts towards the right to deeper blues and purples, including bold shades of blue. One stripe near the far right features a lighter, almost white, thin line interrupting the continuity of the stripe. The rightmost part of the image displays a solid and vivid cobalt blue. The colors are blended subtly at the edges, creating gradients and giving a sense of depth and movement.
