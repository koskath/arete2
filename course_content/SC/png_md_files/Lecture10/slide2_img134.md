The image contains a linear arrangement of vertical elements on the right side, consisting of alternating thick and thin dark blue bars against a white background, resembling a barcode pattern. On the left side, there is a solid blue triangular shape with a wide base that narrows to a point at the top. The area between the blue triangular shape and the barcode pattern is white, creating a clear separation between the two distinct sections of the image.
