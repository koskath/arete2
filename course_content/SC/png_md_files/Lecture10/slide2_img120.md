The image contains vertical dark blue stripes on the left side, with varying widths and spacing. These stripes are closely packed and appear to have a uniform direction from top to bottom. In the center and right side of the image, there is a larger dark blue shape which extends diagonally from the top center toward the bottom right. The diagonal shape has irregular curved edges. The background is white, providing contrast to the blue elements. The striped pattern and the diagonal shape are the two main elements visible.
