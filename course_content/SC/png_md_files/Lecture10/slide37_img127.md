The image is almost entirely white with a thin vertical gradient line positioned near the left edge. The line transitions from a deep blue at the very bottom to a lighter blue as it progresses upwards. The gradient line gradually fades into the white background, becoming nearly invisible as it reaches the top third of the image. There are no other visible elements, structures, shapes, annotations, or details in the image.
