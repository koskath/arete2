The image shows a linear gradient pattern composed of vertical lines with varying widths. The leftmost section of the image features narrow stripes with a diverse color range, including dark shades of green, teal, black, and dark blue. These stripes are interspersed with thinner, lighter-toned lines in colors like silver, steel blue, and pale blue. This side of the image creates a more complex and intricate appearance due to the varying colors and stripe widths.

As the eye moves towards the right side of the image, the stripes become thicker and more uniform in color. The central portion of the image primarily consists of various shades of blue, with a gradual transition from darker blues to more saturated, vibrant cobalt blue tones. The far right portion appears predominantly solid in a deep and bright blue.

The overall composition displays a transition from a complex and varied color pattern on the left to a more simplified uniform blue on the right, creating a perceived sense of flow and movement from left to right. The linear nature of the pattern and the subtle blending of colors contribute to the visual progression across the image.
