The image is a pie chart divided into five segments, each representing a proportion of a whole, with percentages included inside each segment. The segments are differently colored and annotated according to the following:

1. A purple segment labeled "16%" occupies the top right portion of the pie chart.
2. A light blue segment labeled "16%" is to the right, slightly below the purple segment.
3. A light green segment labeled "6%" is further to the right and slightly below the blue segment.
4. A yellow segment labeled "6%" is at the bottom, adjacent to the green segment.
5. A brown segment labeled "56%" occupies the largest portion on the left side of the pie chart.

To the right of the pie chart, there is a color-coded key with five labels aligned vertically, each matching the color of the respective segment in the pie chart:

- A purple box labeled "Ocean Transit."
- A light blue box labeled "Terminal."
- A light green box labeled "Inland Use."
- A yellow box labeled "Repair."
- A brown box labeled "Idle or Empty Repositioning."
