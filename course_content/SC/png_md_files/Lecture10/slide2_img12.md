3. A narrow band of light green, also blurred.
4. A slightly wider band of dark green.
5. A medium-width band of gray with a hint of green.
6. A wide band predominately in shades of dark green and brown, appearing blurry.
7. A narrow, distinct band of bright blue.
8. A wider band of gray with beige.
9. A medium band of pale beige.
10. Ending on the far right, another thin band of light blue similar to the leftmost one.

The bands are vertically oriented, alternating between distinctly bright colors and muted, blurred hues. The borders between some bands are sharp, while others are more blended.
