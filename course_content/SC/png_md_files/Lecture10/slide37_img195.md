The image consists of numerous vertical stripes of varying colors and widths that blend into each other across the entire frame. The predominant colors present include various shades of blue, as well as green, black, and gray. Starting from the left, the colors transition from dark greens and blacks to lighter grays and blues as they move towards the right side of the image. Towards the center, there is a distinct section where the colors become lighter, almost white, contributing to a blurred effect, before transitioning into deep blues on the right side. Each stripe appears seamless, with no distinct lines separating the different sections, creating a gradient and striped appearance that stretches horizontally across the image.
