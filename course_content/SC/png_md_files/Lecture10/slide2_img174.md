The image consists of vertical stripes of various shades of blue, transitioning from left to right. On the left side, the colors are darker, featuring a mix of deep blacks and navy blues with a few lighter streaks. There are several thin, alternating lines of grays and muted lighter blues interspersed within the dark colors. As the image progresses toward the center, the stripes gradually become lighter and more vibrant, transitioning into rich royal blues and azure tones. 

The right side of the image is dominated by a solid, bright, vivid blue area. This area acts as a stark contrast to the more varied and darker palette on the left. The transition from the left to the right is a smooth gradient where the mixture of colors turns into a unified, intense blue shade. This solid blue portion takes up about a third of the entire width of the image on the far right. 

At the extreme right edge, there is a thin vertical strip of white, serving as a boundary between the blue area and the edge of the image.
