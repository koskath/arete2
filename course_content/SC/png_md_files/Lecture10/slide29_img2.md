The image contains a diagram with three main rectangular nodes, each outlined in black:

1. The first rectangle on the left is labeled "Freight Forwarder at home." It is encircled with a red, freehand, irregular closed curve. There are five black arrows pointing to and from this rectangle:
   - A double-headed arrow pointing right towards the center rectangle.
   - A single-headed arrow pointing left away from the rectangle.
   - A single-headed arrow pointing directly below.
   - Two single-headed arrows pointing diagonally outward (one towards the upper left and another towards the lower left).

2. The center rectangle is labeled "Transportation Broker or Agent." It connects to the other two rectangles with two double-headed arrows:
   - To the left, it is connected to the "Freight Forwarder at home."
   - To the right, it is connected to the "Freight Forwarder abroad."

3. The right rectangle is labeled "Freight Forwarder abroad." It is also encircled with a red, freehand, irregular closed curve. There are five black arrows pointing to and from this rectangle:
   - A double-headed arrow pointing left towards the center rectangle.
   - A single-headed arrow pointing right away from the rectangle.
   - A single-headed arrow pointing directly below.
   - Two single-headed arrows pointing diagonally outward (one towards the upper right and another towards the lower right).

All elements are connected with solid black lines and black triangular arrowheads to indicate direction. The red curves are hand-drawn and provide emphasis on the first and third rectangles.
