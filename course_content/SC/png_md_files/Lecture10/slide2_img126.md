The image shows a partial view of a barcode on a white background. The barcode consists of vertical lines varying in width and spacing. Most lines are vertical and straight, but one line on the right side is angled diagonally to the right. The lines are dark blue, and the background is completely white. The segment shown is incomplete, with lines cropped at the top and bottom edges. There is also a small section of dark blue, partially legible text at the top right, reading "CIMIT RINP" with letters likely cropped or distorted.
