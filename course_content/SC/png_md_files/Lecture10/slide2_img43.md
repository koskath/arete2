The image is predominantly white with a very narrow, vertical colored strip on the left side. The strip consists of closely spaced, parallel lines that blend from blue to slightly lighter shades, creating a gradient effect. The lines are uniform and create a subtle, almost imperceptible texture against the white background. There are no visible annotations, shapes, or other elements present.
