The image is a graph with the title "Comparisons" at the top in large blue font. Below, the subtitle "Costs and Transit Time 2006* vs. 2017" is written in smaller dark blue font. Another subtitle within parentheses, "(40’ Container with 10 t from Shanghai, China to Hamburg, Germany)," is present beneath the main subtitle in even smaller font.

The graph features a vertical axis labeled "Costs (USD)" on the left, with tick marks and labels at 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, and 35,000.

There are four circular markers on the graph, two orange and two light blue, denoting different data points. The orange markers are labeled "Air*" (lower) and "Air" (higher). The light blue markers are labeled "Sea-Air" (lower) and "Sea-Air*" (higher).

There are bold yellow arrows pointing from the lower circular markers to the higher markers (from "Air*" to "Air" and from "Sea-Air" to "Sea-Air*").

Red hand-drawn circles, lines, and arrows are present on the image. The red circles encircle each marker on the graph. Red lines connect the clusters of circles, forming loose connections among the data points. Additional red marks resemble question marks and exclamation points near the light blue markers.
