The image is composed of abstract vertical stripes and gradients. On the left side, there is a narrow vertical section with a gradient ranging from light blue to slightly darker blue. This section transitions into a set of closely packed vertical lines in varying shades of blue, grey, purple, and white. These lines are thin and create a striped pattern with no distinct edges. Towards the right side, the image becomes predominantly dark blue, forming a large area that slopes diagonally downward from left to right. The overall effect is a transition from light on the left to dark on the right, with a mixture of colors and stripes forming a cohesive abstract composition.
