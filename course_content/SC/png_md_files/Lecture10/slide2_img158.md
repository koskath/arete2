The image is comprised of a series of vertical stripes arranged horizontally across the entire frame. On the left side, the stripes begin with very narrow lines and a mixed color palette, primarily consisting of darker shades of blue, grey, and black. These stripes appear irregular in width but are tightly packed.

As the stripes proceed to the right, they gradually become wider and more uniform in color. The colors transition to various shades of blue, with the darkest tones on the left and progressively lighter hues moving to the right.

On the far right side, the stripes converge into a broad, solid block of deep blue that occupies about one-third of the image's width. This block appears uniform in color and texture without any variations. There are no annotations, text, or additional symbols present in the image.
