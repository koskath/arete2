The image depicts a map highlighting various railway corridors across Europe and Asia. The background is a light blue color, representing the ocean and surrounding geographical areas, with white landmasses.

Railway corridors are marked in different colors:

1. **Western Corridor (黑色)**:
   - Begins on the western edge in Madrid, extending through important cities such as Paris, Antwerp, London, Duisburg, and Hamburg.
   - Passes through Berlin, Warsaw, Minsk, Malaszewice, and Moscow. 
   - Continues eastward through Russia, eventually connecting to the Manchurian corridor.

2. **Central Channel (红色)**:
   - Starts near Duisburg and extends through Warsaw and Malaszewice.
   - Proceeds through Moscow, traveling across Kazakhstan (including cities like Alma-Ata and Alashankou).
   - Enters China through Ürümqi, continuing through Lanzhou, Xian, and other eastern cities. 

3. **Eastern Channel (绿色)**: 
   - Originates in Harbin and travels through important northeastern cities like Shengyang.
   - Passes through Erenhot, then converges with other channels in central China, moving through major cities such as Beijing.

4. **South Channel (紫色)**:
   - Begins in Madrid, traverses through southern Europe including major bottlenecks at Istanbul and Tbilisi.
   - Continues through the Middle East, with notable stops at Baku and Teheran.
   - Merges with other corridors as it approaches central Asia.

5. **There is an orange channel** branching off from the Eastern Channel in Manchuria, heading toward the Chinese-Russian border. 

Key cities and their names both in English and Chinese are annotated throughout the map, alongside points of railway crossover indicated with a black circle with a white X inside. Major Chinese cities include Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

Overall, the map demonstrates the interconnectedness of rail transport networks between Europe and Asia, highlighting strategic urban hubs and the pathways that enable international rail commerce.
