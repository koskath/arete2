The image is divided into two main sections. 

On the left side, there is a series of vertical stripes that vary in color and width. These stripes transition from narrow to slightly wider bands and consist of shades of blue, ranging from light to dark, with some subtle gradients and variations. The colors blend together in a linear fashion, creating a striped pattern with no distinct borders between each hue.

On the right side, the section is predominantly a solid, deep blue area taking up most of the right half of the image. This section is sharply separated from the left side's striped pattern by a distinct edge. There is a slight, subtle gradient within this blue area, giving it a gentle depth but maintaining the dominance of the blue color.

The entire composition presents a contrast between the busy, multicolored striped pattern on the left and the calm, uniform blue area on the right. No annotations, labels, or other markings are present on the image.
