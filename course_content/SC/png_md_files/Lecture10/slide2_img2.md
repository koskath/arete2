The image features a predominantly white background with a series of vertical blue lines concentrated on the left side, extending vertically off the visible area of the image. These lines vary slightly in thickness, creating a dense cluster. To the right, a section of a large, diagonal blue band is visible, stretching from the top center to the lower right edge. Within this band, the partial text "COPENHAGEN BLU" is visible in uppercase white letters towards the bottom, with the rest of the text extending out of the frame. The central part of the image contains blurred details, suggesting other potential elements, but they remain indistinct within the visible section. The overall appearance is abstract, focusing primarily on the interplay of blue and white, with textual elements partially visible.
