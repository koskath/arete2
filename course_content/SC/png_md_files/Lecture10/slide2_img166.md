The image consists of vertical lines and bands that vary in color and width across the composition. On the far left side, there are thin bands in shades of dark blue, black, and slightly bluish-grey. These bands are closely packed and intermixed, creating a gradient effect. As one moves to the right, the bands become progressively broader and more uniformly colored. The central portion predominantly features narrower vertical lines of blue shades that gradually transition into a more consistent bright blue. On the far right, a wide section of solid, bright cobalt blue occupies a large portion of the composition. There appears to be a slight linear element at an angle near the blue area, suggesting a diagonal line or edge peeking in from the lower quadrant. Overall, the image transitions smoothly from dark, mixed shades on the left to a solid, bright, homogeneous blue on the right.
