The image contains several vertical blue lines of varying thickness against a white background. The lines are gradient, starting from a darker blue at the edges and lightening towards the center. They are parallel in alignment but positioned at different intervals. The blue lines have a slight blur effect, creating a softer appearance. There is also a diagonal line of bluish tint crossing part of the image from the top left to the bottom right, intersecting with the vertical lines creating an image of layered or overlapped linear forms. The overall composition is abstract and symmetrical.
