The image is a line chart with multiple data series, represented by different colors and styles, plotted over a timeline. 

- The x-axis is labeled with months and years in German, from "Nov." to "Mär." and spans multiple years: 2016 to 2023.
- The y-axis is not visible, and therefore no specific values or labels can be discerned.

The chart comprises six distinct data lines:

1. **Light Blue Line:** Represented by circles at data points, this line starts lower on the left and undulates slightly upwards towards the right. It experiences a peak towards the midpoint and then fluctuates, ending towards the lower middle area of the graph.

2. **Dark Blue Line:** Also with circles at data points, this line generally mirrors the trends of the light blue line but in a more pronounced, oscillating manner. It takes a sharp ascent towards the middle of the graph, reaching a significant peak, and then declines steeply.

3. **Orange Line:** This line is more stable, remaining mostly horizontal across the timeline with subtle fluctuations around the middle of the chart.

4. **Yellow Line:** Almost indistinguishable from the orange line, it stays at a similar horizontal level, indicating minimal variation.

5. **Light Red Line:** Closely parallels the orange and yellow lines with a stable, horizontal path indicating minor changes over time.

6. **Red Line:** Overlaid on part of the light red line, it shows minimal fluctuation and follows a similar horizontal trajectory.

At the top left of the image, the number "2017" is handwritten in red. Additionally, two broad red circles are drawn on the graph, one on the left and one on the right, encircling parts of the data lines:

- **Left Circle:** Encloses a section where the light blue, dark blue, and other lines intersect and show one of the few subtle deviations.
- **Right Circle:** Highlights an area of pronounced fluctuation where the dark blue and light blue lines intersect and peak prominently.

Background grid lines are visible, enhancing the readability of the chart. There are no visible numeric labels on the lines themselves.
