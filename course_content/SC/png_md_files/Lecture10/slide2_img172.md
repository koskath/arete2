The image consists of vertical stripes of varying widths and colors. On the left side, the stripes are predominantly dark tones, including black and deep navy blue, intermixed with narrower lighter blue and gray stripes. These stripes are closely packed together with thin divisions. As the pattern progresses to the right, the stripes shift gradually towards a uniformly bright royal blue color, which occupies the rightmost portion of the image. This right section is composed of a solid, unbroken blue strip that is wider than the individual stripes on the left. There are no annotations, labels, or additional shapes present in the image.
