The image contains blue handwritten text on a white background. The handwriting is cursive and somewhat difficult to decipher, with irregular spacing and slant. Below is an attempt to transcribe the text:

- RELYING UITH D2D
LS LEADING PAPERT CAN’T CONT LOUR?
AND RELATI .. 

In the lower right corner, the number "45" is written in blue. The text appears to be a blend of uppercase and lowercase letters, with some words being less legible than others. Several letters are connected in a flowing cursive manner. Some punctuation marks are present, such as dots following "AND RELATI". The overall writing style is informal and hastily written.
