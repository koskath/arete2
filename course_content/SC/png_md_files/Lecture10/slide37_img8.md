The image is composed of a series of vertical stripes, each with varying colors and widths. The stripes are arranged adjacent to each other, stretching across the image from left to right. 

- Starting from the left, there is a narrow dark gray stripe, followed by a wider band of lighter gray.
- Next, a thin stripe of dark green is visible, succeeded by a slightly wider stripe of a lighter greenish-gray color.
- Several more stripes of varying shades of gray and green follow, alternating in narrow and slightly wider bands.
- About a quarter from the left, a thicker stripe of dark gray is present.
- Continuing right, the green shades transition into grayish tones with occasional thin bands of very light gray, almost white, and darker blacks and greens.
- Towards the center of the image, there is a prominent bright blue stripe, relatively wider than the preceding stripes.
- The blue is flanked by a narrow dark band, and to its right, there are alternating vertical stripes that include dark gray, light gray, and a muted violet-brown band which is thinner.
- On the far right, just before the edge of the image, there is another thick vertical band. This segment contains a combination of muted brown and gray tones interspersed with very thin stripes of light and dark shades.

The overall composition creates a gradient-like appearance, moving from muted green and gray tones on the left through to blues and browns on the right, highlighting variations in stripe width and color intensity.
