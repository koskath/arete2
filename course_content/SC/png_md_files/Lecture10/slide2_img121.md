The image shows a tightly cropped section of a pattern consisting of vertical and diagonal lines. On the left side, there are thin, parallel, dark blue vertical stripes with varying thicknesses and spacing, running downwards and converging towards a point due to perspective distortion, creating a gradient-like effect. As it transitions to the right side, the lines start to angle diagonally with a slight blue hue, moving from the upper right toward the bottom left of the image. The lines are set against a white background, enhancing their visibility. The entire composition suggests a dynamic flow from left to right, with a shift in direction and thickness, contributing to a sense of motion. The edges appear slightly blurred, intensifying the sense of depth and movement.
