The image consists of a series of vertical lines filling the entire frame. On the left side, there are numerous narrow, multicolored vertical lines that vary in width and color. These include shades of blue, gray, dark green, and black. The colors and line widths are irregular and vary in a somewhat random pattern.

Moving towards the center and right side of the image, the lines gradually transition into a large, contiguous block of solid blue on the far right. This blue section occupies roughly one-third of the image space. The transition from the multicolored lines to the solid blue area is relatively abrupt, indicating a clear distinction between the two sections.

The vertical lines are consistent in orientation and occupy the entire vertical length of the image. There are no labels, annotations, or additional markings present in the image. The overall composition shows a strong contrast between the varied multicolored lines on the left and the solid blue area on the right.
