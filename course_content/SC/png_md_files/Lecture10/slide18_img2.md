The image is a graph with a horizontal axis labeled "Distance" and a vertical axis labeled "Transport costs per unit." Three lines represent different modes of transport: 

1. A blue line labeled "Road" begins at the origin and slopes upward. 

2. An orange line labeled "Rail" starts from a higher position on the y-axis and has a moderate upward slope.

3. A green line labeled "Maritime" begins even higher on the y-axis with a gentle upward slope.

Two vertical dashed lines labeled "D1" and "D2" divide the graph into three segments. The blue line intersects the orange line at "D1," marked by a white circle. All three lines intersect at "D2," marked by another white circle. 

The annotations "C1," "C2," and "C3" are placed near the ending points of the blue, orange, and green lines, respectively, on the right side of the graph. 

Background annotations identify "Road" in a dark section, "Rail" in an orange section, and "Maritime" in a green section, each corresponding to the respective line colors.
