The image contains a series of vertical and slightly diagonal lines on a white background. Most of the lines are thin and blue, varying slightly in shade. They are arranged in a seemingly random pattern, with a concentration of lines towards the left side of the image, tapering off towards the right. The lines appear wavy or distorted, creating an effect of movement or blurring.

In the bottom part of the image, slightly diagonal text is present, partially visible, and appears in a blue serif font. The visible part of the text starts with "HE CBS C ASE SERIE," in capital letters, and below it, “on trainer t” can be seen, also in lowercase letters. The letters are slightly blurred, creating a sense of motion or distortion.

There are no figures, annotations, or other graphical elements present besides the lines and text.
