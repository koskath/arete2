The image contains several elongated, tapered shapes varying in color from black to various shades of blue. The shapes are arranged vertically, slightly angled and diminishing in width from top to bottom. The first shape on the left is completely black. Adjacent to it are multiple thin, closely packed lines in dark gray, creating a blurred appearance. The next shapes are broader, with gradients transitioning from blue to white, and each has soft edges. There is visible spacing between the shapes, and parts of other shapes can be seen on the right side, slightly overlapping and displaying a mix of gradient blues. The background is white, providing a stark contrast to the shapes. There are no visible annotations, text, or other graphical elements within this section.
