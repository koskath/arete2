The image contains a black shape resembling a thick, curved line similar to an extrusion of a water drop, oriented with the wider end at the top left and tapering to a point at the bottom right. The edges are smooth and continuous, with no visible texture or additional elements. The background is transparent, allowing the focus to remain entirely on the shape itself. There are no annotations, text, or other objects in the image, and the shape fills most of the space vertically, while positioned slightly to the left horizontally.
