The image consists of multiple vertical stripes, each with varying colors and widths. From left to right, the colors appear as follows:

1. A narrow strip of very dark green, almost black.
2. A wide band of muted olive green.
3. A thin line of dark gray.
4. A medium-width band of lighter gray.
5. An olive-yellow shade with medium thickness.
6. Another band of muted olive green, wider than previous.
7. A small section of bluish-gray, medium thickness.
8. A band of deep, vivid blue, notably wider than the others.
9. On top of the blue band, white letters spell "CBS" in a serif font.
10. A medium-wide stripe of dark brown.

All the stripes appear to connect seamlessly, without any noticeable gaps or interruptions between them.
