The image features a series of slightly curved, narrow, vertical lines that are evenly spaced. The lines vary in shades of blue, ranging from pale to medium blue. They create a pattern against a plain white background. The lines are slightly tilted to the left and do not cover the entire width of the image, instead appearing concentrated on the left side with some white space between them, fading into more blank white space towards the right. The lines differ in intensity and create a gradient-like effect across the width of the image.
