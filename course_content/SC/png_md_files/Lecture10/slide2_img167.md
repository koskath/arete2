The image is composed of vertical stripes of varying widths, extending from the top to the bottom of the image, filling the entire frame. The predominant colors of the stripes range from dark shades of blue to black, with occasional presence of lighter blue tones. The stripes are arranged closely together without any gaps in between. On the left side of the image, the stripes are darker and narrower. As one moves towards the right, the stripes become progressively broader and more brightly colored, shifting towards vivid blue tones. The transition is gradual, with no abrupt changes in color or width. There are no annotations, text, or additional elements visible in the image. The overall pattern creates a gradient effect from dark to bright along the horizontal axis.
