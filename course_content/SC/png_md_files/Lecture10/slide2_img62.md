The image shows a portion of a text with blue, vertical, narrow lines running across it. These lines are evenly spaced and appear to distort the text, giving it a blurred effect. The visible part of the text in the background reads, "THE CASE IS BEIN...". The vertical lines are aligned closely together, creating a striped pattern over the text. The text is in capital letters and appears to be slanted slightly to the right. The background is predominantly white, and the lines, along with the distorted text, are in shades of blue.
