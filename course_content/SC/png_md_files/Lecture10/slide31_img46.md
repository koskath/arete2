The image shows a bold, uppercase letter "T" followed by a bold, uppercase letter "I." The letters are black and appear to be in a sans-serif font style with uniform thickness. The "T" has a horizontal bar that balances evenly atop the central vertical line. The "I" is a simple vertical line, slightly shorter than the central segment of the "T." Both letters are aligned and spaced closely together, creating a compact visual appearance. The background is solid white, providing a stark contrast to the bold black letters.
