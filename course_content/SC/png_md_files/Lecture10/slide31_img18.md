The image consists of two large, bold, black capital letters against a white background. The letter "P" is on the left side, characterized by its straight vertical left side and a rounded right side that forms a semicircle enclosed space in the middle. To the right, the letter "L" is composed of two perpendicular lines forming a right angle; the vertical line extends downwards, while the horizontal line extends towards the right. There is no additional text, annotation, or visible detail beyond the two black letters "P" and "L" against the white background. The letters are positioned close to each other but not touching.
