The image consists of vertical stripes predominantly in shades of blue with occasional dark and light accents. On the far left, there are narrow, alternating stripes mainly in very dark blue and black. As we move toward the right, the blue tones become brighter and more vivid, transitioning into a series of medium to light blue stripes. The stripes vary in width, with some very thin and others wider, creating a pattern of contrasting bands. Towards the right edge, there is a large solid section of deep, vivid blue, which occupies a significant portion of the image, forming a bold, continuous block of color. The overall composition is structured with clean lines and transitions, emphasizing the horizontal alignment and color gradation from left to right.
