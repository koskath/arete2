The image contains a white background with a thin, vertical gradient line positioned to the far left. The line is narrow and tapers as it moves up from the bottom. The gradient begins with a deep blue color at the base and gradually transitions to a lighter blue and then fades into white as it ascends. There are no other visible elements, shapes, annotations, or structures in the image. The rest of the image beyond the line consists entirely of a blank white space.
