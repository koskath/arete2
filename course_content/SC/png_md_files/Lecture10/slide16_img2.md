The image contains a graph with two axes. The horizontal axis is labeled "Distance," and the vertical axis is labeled "Rate." The graph features a single curve starting from near the origin of the axes, curving upwards and to the right. Initially, the curve rises steeply before gradually flattening out as it extends to the right, approaching a horizontal asymptote. The curve indicates that as "Distance" increases, "Rate" increases at a decreasing rate. There are no grid lines, data points, or additional labels on the axes beyond the axis titles. The graph occupies the lower left to upper right area of the image. There are no additional elements, text, or markings present in the image.
