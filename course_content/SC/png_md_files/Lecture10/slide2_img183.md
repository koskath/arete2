The image is divided into two distinct vertical parts. 

On the left side, there is a series of vertical streaks of varying colors. These streaks include shades of black, gray, blue, and beige, creating a blend of dark and muted tones with some highlights. The gradient effect makes these streaks appear textured and unevenly spaced.

On the right side, there is a solid, vivid blue rectangle occupying approximately half of the image. The blue hue is consistent across this section, providing a stark contrast to the multicolored streaks on the left. 

The boundary between the two sections is a sharp vertical line with no blending. There are no additional annotations, shapes, or visible details beyond these elements.
