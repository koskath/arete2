The image is composed of a structured, comparative diagram that displays different modes of transportation across four columns labeled "Sea," "Rail," "Road," and "Air." Four categories are compared in rows titled "Load quantities," "Transport cost," "Tied up capital," and "Delivery service," each contained within a rectangular box in the center of the image.

1. The top row has the label "Load quantities" contained in a rectangular box. A horizontal double-headed arrow extends from "Sea" on the left, labeled "Large," to "Air" on the right, labeled "Small."

2. The second row contains the label "Transport cost" within a rectangular box. A horizontal double-headed arrow extends from "Sea" on the left, labeled "Low," to "Air" on the right, labeled "High."

3. The third row displays "Tied up capital" inside a rectangular box. A horizontal double-headed arrow extends from "Sea" on the left, labeled "High," to "Air" on the right, labeled "Low."

4. The bottom row contains "Delivery service" within a rectangular box. A horizontal double-headed arrow extends from "Sea" on the left, labeled "Low," to "Air" on the right, labeled "High."

All rows align vertically to their respective categories, and arrows indicate a gradient of characteristics from one mode of transport to another. There is consistent spacing between the rows and columns, creating a neatly organized matrix.
