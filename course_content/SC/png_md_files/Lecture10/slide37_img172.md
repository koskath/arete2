The image consists of vertical color bands spanning horizontally. The left side features numerous thin stripes predominantly in shades of blue, black, and dark grey. These stripes are of varying thicknesses and are closely placed, giving a dense and textured appearance. As the eye moves from left to right, the stripes gradually become fewer and widen until the right side of the image, which is dominated by a large expanse of a deep, solid blue. The transition from the striped area to the solid blue is gradual, with the stripes thinning out and eventually merging into the solid color. There are no other visible elements, annotations, or structures in the image. The top, bottom, and sides of the image are framed by thin white borders.
