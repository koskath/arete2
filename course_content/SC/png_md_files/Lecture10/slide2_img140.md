The image consists of two distinct vertical sections set against a white background. On the left side, there is a wide, blue gradient band that smoothly transitions from a lighter blue on the right edge to a darker blue hue towards the left edge. This band takes up approximately one-quarter of the image's width. 

In the middle of the image, there is a narrow white gap separating the blue band from the right section. 

On the right side of the image, a set of dark blue vertical stripes runs parallel, with varying thicknesses. These stripes appear to be distorted, with some areas thicker and others thinner, giving a wavy impression. The vertical stripes occupy the remaining three-quarters of the image. 

There are no visible annotations, labels, shapes, or other distinct elements in the image apart from the described color bands and stripes.
