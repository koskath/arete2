The image contains a series of concentric rectangles with inscriptions written in red. From the outermost to the innermost:

1. The largest rectangle, outlined in black, has the word "AIR" written in red at the top-left corner and "SEA" in red at the top-right corner.
   
2. Inside the first rectangle, there is a second, smaller black rectangle. Centered within this rectangle is the word "MULTINORM" written in red.

3. Within the second rectangle, there is a third, even smaller black rectangle. Centered, the word "INTERNALORM" is written in red.

4. The innermost rectangle also contains a single-center-aligned word, "COMBINED," written in red.

The words are handwritten with variations in size and spacing, and all text is oriented horizontally.
