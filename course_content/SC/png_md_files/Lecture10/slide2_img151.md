The image consists of vertical stripes that vary in color and width across the composition. On the left side, there are numerous closely spaced vertical lines predominantly in shades of blue, gray, and black, creating a dense pattern. These stripes are thin, and their colors blend into each other at certain points. As the pattern moves towards the right, the lines become less dense and transition into a wide solid area of deep blue extending to the edge of the image. This section is notably thicker than the striped area on the left, creating a distinct contrast in texture and color. The entire composition has a linear and symmetrical arrangement, with the transition from multiple thin lines to a solid block of color.
