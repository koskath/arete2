The image consists of a partial view of a Euro symbol, primarily composed of blue vertical stripes and bending forms. The left side of the image has a tall, solid blue triangle that tapers off toward the bottom. Adjacent to this triangle, on the right, are a series of alternating thick and thin blue vertical lines that resemble a barcode pattern. The background is predominantly white, providing contrast with the blue elements. The bottom right side shows the start of some blue curved shapes and rounded text contours in blue, without any complete characters being visible. The edges of the image are trimmed, focusing primarily on the vertical stripe and curved pattern elements.
