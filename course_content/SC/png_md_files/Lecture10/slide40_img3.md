The image contains a schematic diagram with multiple arrows, boxes, and text elements arranged horizontally and vertically.

**Left Side:**
1. Six horizontal arrows pointing from left to right.
   - The first three arrows are solid lines with no annotations.
   - The fourth arrow starts from "Container-Terminal Container Yard" and points right.
   - The fifth arrow, starting further to the right, includes text: "Vorlauf in: - Carriers Haulage oder - Merchants Haulage."
   - The sixth arrow is accompanied by dashed lines pointing from left to right with a slight curve heading back to the left at the end. Annotations include:
     - "Lastlauf"
     - "in Carriers Haulage"
     - "Leerlauf von CY"

2. Below these horizontal arrows, there is a hollow rectangular box labeled "Container-Terminal Container Yard."

**Right Side:**
1. Six horizontal arrows pointing from right to left, mirroring the left side.
   - The first three arrows are solid lines with no annotations.
   - The fourth arrow, starting from the right, moves left and is labeled "FCL/LCL CY/CFS."
   - The fifth arrow is labeled "Nachlauf in: - Carriers Haulage oder - Merchants Haulage."
   - The sixth arrow includes dashed lines, slightly curved back at the end, and is annotated with:
     - "Lastlauf"
     - "in Merchants Haulage"
     - "Leerlauf nach CY"

2. Below these arrows, there is another hollow rectangular box labeled "Container-Terminal Container Yard," which mirrors the left side box.

**Center Section:**
1. Connecting the two sides, there is a horizontal dashed arrow between the two central boxes labeled with "Container."

The components in this diagram are mirrored on each side, highlighting the structural flow between left and right sections. It primarily illustrates container terminals, haulage processes, and yard interactions.
