The image features a vertical pattern with two distinct sections. On the left side, there is a series of closely spaced, narrow vertical lines, predominantly in shades of blue, black, and purple, creating a textured appearance. These lines are parallel and vary in thickness and darkness. On the right side, there is a large solid block of a deep, vibrant blue color, which is smooth and lacks any visible texture or lines. This section occupies approximately the right half of the image, transitioning smoothly into the textured lines on the left. There are no additional shapes, annotations, or structures visible in the image.
