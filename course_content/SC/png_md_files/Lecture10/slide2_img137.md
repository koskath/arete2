The image shows a section of abstract shapes and text. On the left side, there is a gradient blue shape transitioning from dark to light blue towards the center. To the right of this shape, the text "FINISHED" is partially visible, with some letters cut off due to the image boundary. The text is bold and tilted slightly, with the letters "I" and "S" being more visible. The background is primarily white, and the overall layout is simple and minimalistic.
