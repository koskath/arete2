The image illustrates a section of a port or container terminal operation.

1. **Left Side:**
   - A large dockside crane in gray, consisting of a tall vertical support with a lattice structure, extends over the water and the dock.
   - The crane has a complex truss design at the top, with two arms extending horizontally over the dock area.
   - A circular spool or drum is on the left side of the vertical support.
   - Several stacked green containers are depicted on a vessel partially submerged in blue water.
   - The water and dock are represented with a red and blue shaded area, indicating water depth or dock level.

2. **Middle Section:**
   - On the dock, there is a red straddle carrier lifting a green container. This carrier is open in the middle and has a cab or control area at the top.
   - The dock surface is represented as a flat black line with multiple green containers stacked along the surface.

3. **Right Side:**
   - Further along the dock, another red straddle carrier is moving a green container, depicted to the right of the first carrier.
   - The carriers have visible diagonal support structures on the sides.
   - A row of green containers is stacked behind these straddle carriers.
   - There is a truck on the far right connected to one of the straddle carriers.

4. **Foreground:**
   - There are two parallel black lines, possibly representing a break or boundary in the area, cutting horizontally across the image.
   - Below this, another set of green containers is arranged neatly in two layers, indicating additional storage or staging areas.

5. **Overall Layout:**
   - The scene is linear, indicating operations along a dockside with vertically and horizontally aligned components.
   - The equipment and containers are in red and green colors, contrasting against the gray structures and light background.
