The image consists of a series of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths, spanning from left to right. Starting on the left side, there are thin, tightly packed stripes with shades including light green, grey, and blue. These stripes vary in intensity, with some appearing more muted or pastel. As the image progresses toward the right, the colors shift to darker tones, predominantly dark grey and blue, with occasional thin light-colored stripes interspersed between them.

About halfway across the image, the stripes transition to primarily deep blues and rich blue tones, which dominate the remaining half of the image. These stripes are broader and more uniformly colored compared to the earlier part of the image. The background where these stripes are located is not visible, and there are no discernible shapes, annotations, or other markings within the image. 

The rightmost section appears as a solid block of very deep blue with no visible variance in color or texture, giving the impression of completeness on the right edge of the image. Throughout the image, the stripes maintain a vertical orientation, consistently running from the top to the bottom while varying in width and intensity.
