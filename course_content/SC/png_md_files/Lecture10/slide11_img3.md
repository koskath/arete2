The image consists of a white background divided into three vertical sections by two black vertical lines. The sections are as follows:

1. **Left Section**: 
   - Contains red handwritten letters that appear to be "VID BUP."
   - The letters are aligned towards the bottom-left corner of the section.

2. **Middle Section**:
   - This section is empty, showing only the white background.

3. **Right Section**:
   - Contains red handwritten letters that appear to be "FCL LCL."
   - The letters are aligned towards the bottom of the section, starting from the center and extending to the right.

The text is written in a casual, cursive style with the letters connected to each other. The black vertical lines are of uniform width and divide the image into three equal parts. There are no other visible elements, annotations, or details in the image.
