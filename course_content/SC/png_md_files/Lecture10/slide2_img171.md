The image contains a mostly white background with a thin blue vertical stripe on the left side. This stripe is solid in color and appears continuous from the top to the bottom of the image. To the right of the vertical stripe, there is a wide diagonal blue band that starts from the top left and extends downward toward the center right. This band has a gradient, transitioning from a lighter blue on the left edge to a darker blue on the right edge. The diagonal band intersects with the vertical stripe at the top left corner. There are no other visible elements, structures, shapes, annotations, or data points present in the image.
