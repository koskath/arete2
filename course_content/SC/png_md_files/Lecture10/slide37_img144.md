The image consists of vertical and slightly angled lines merging into a gradient on a white background. 

- On the left side, there is a narrow vertical blue band with a subtle gradient. 
- Adjacent to it, multiple closely placed vertical lines appear stretching downwards. These lines vary in shades of blue, purple, and gray, creating a striped pattern.
- As the lines progress to the right, they increase in width and intensity of color, shifting to deeper shades of blue.
- The thickest vertical segment is a rich, deep blue, positioned slightly off-center to the right.
- After this deep blue section, the dark blue fades and narrows towards the bottom-right, forming a diagonal edge.
- There are subtle but distinct transitions and interactions between the colors, gradually shifting from darker left to lighter shades at the right's edge.
- The background is predominantly white with small segments of color encroaching into it along the sides, emphasizing the contrast with the blue gradients.
