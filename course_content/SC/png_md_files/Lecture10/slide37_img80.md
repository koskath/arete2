The image consists of a series of vertical and slightly diagonal lines in varying shades of blue and grey against a white background. The lines are thin and closely spaced, with some appearing more prominent and darker than others. In the lower right corner, partially visible text in blue is present, but is mostly cut off, with only the tops of the letters visible. The lines create a pattern that runs diagonally across the image from top left to bottom right. There is a subtle gradient effect present in the lines, particularly those in shades of blue. The overall composition appears abstract, with no discernible objects or figures.
