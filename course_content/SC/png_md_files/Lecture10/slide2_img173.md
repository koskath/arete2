The image is divided into two distinct vertical sections. On the left side, there is a dense aggregation of vertical lines of varying thicknesses and colors. These lines range from dark blue, nearly black, to lighter shades of blue and intermingle with faint hints of gray and beige. The distribution of these lines is varied, with some lines appearing thicker and more prominent than others. 

Moving to the right side of the image, there is a solid block of uniform royal blue color. This blue section is smooth and consistent in color density, occupying almost half of the image width. There is no visible transition or blending between the left patterned section and the solid blue section; they are sharply divided.

The top and bottom edges of the image frame both sections, providing a clean boundary. The left edge appears to show a slight extension of the patterned section outward, hinting at an outer border or line trailing vertically at the same height as the rest of the lines.
