The image consists of a vertical composition with two main sections. On the left side, there are numerous vertical lines that vary in color including blue, purple, black, and hints of red. These lines are closely packed together, creating a stripe-like pattern that starts from the top and continues downward. Each line has slight variations in intensity and thickness. On the right side, there is a solid dark blue area, which occupies about a third of the image's width. This blue section is uniform in color and gradually extends from the top to the bottom. The border between the striped pattern and the solid blue area is a straight vertical line. The overall impression is one of contrast between a busy, multicolored pattern and a large, calm block of blue.
