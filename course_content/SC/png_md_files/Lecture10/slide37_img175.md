The image consists of a vertical array of tightly packed lines, varying in color. On the left side, the colors are predominantly darker shades such as black, dark blue, gray, and a few narrow strips of lighter colors like beige and muted greens. As the sequence progresses from left to right, some lines appear more blurred or diffused, with smooth transitions, giving a sense of texture or gradient. The lines on the extreme right half of the image shift to a vibrant, solid blue color, occupying about one-third of the image’s width. This blue section is uniform and stark, contrasting with the varied array of lines and colors on the left. The overall composition is a linear gradient with a clear division between the multicolored and solid blue sections.
