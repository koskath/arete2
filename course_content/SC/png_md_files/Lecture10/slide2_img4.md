The image consists of vertically oriented, blurred stripes of various colors. Starting from the left, there are dark gray and black stripes, gradually transitioning to lighter shades of gray. Near the center, there's a thin light gray stripe. Moving further, the colors shift to include greenish and grayish tones. Toward the right section, there is a prominent bright blue stripe. Adjacent to the blue stripe on the right, there are more muted browns and grays. In the same area, there are visible blurry letters, "CBS," on a white background within the blue stripe. The colors appear blended into each other due to the blur effect, with no distinct boundaries between them.
