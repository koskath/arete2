The image consists of a series of vertical columns with varying colors and thicknesses. On the far left, there is a narrow strip of light blue, followed by a sequence of thin vertical columns with interchanging shades of gray, blue, green, and yellow. These columns vary in width and are tightly packed together. In the middle of the image, there are slightly thicker columns with predominant dark blue and bright blue hues. Toward the right side, there is a broad, solid vertical area of deep, vibrant blue. The colors are smooth and gradient-like, blending faintly into one another without distinct boundaries. The entire image has a linear and striped appearance, creating a pattern of vertical lines across its length.
