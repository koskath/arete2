The image consists of a series of vertical stripes that span the entire height of the frame. From left to right, the stripes vary in color and thickness. The colors include multiple shades of green, brown, gray, and blue, transitioning gradually between each other. On the far right of the image, there is a prominent, large area of solid deep blue occupying roughly one-third of the width of the image. The vertical stripes to the left of the solid blue section are narrow, closely packed together, and exhibit a more intricate pattern as they transition from darker to lighter shades. There are no annotations, diagrams, data points, or additional elements present in the image.
