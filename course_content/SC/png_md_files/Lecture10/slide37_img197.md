The image consists of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths. Starting from the left side, there is a narrow black stripe. Next to it is a slightly wider stripe with a gradient of olive green and gray shades, flowing smoothly from one to another. This is followed by another dark stripe in gray tones, slightly darker than the previous.

Continuing rightward, there is a mixture of green to gray tones, broader and blending into each other. Adjacent to it is a wider area with a gradient from dark gray to a light sandy color, transitioning smoothly.

Further right, a bold and vibrant blue stripe stands out prominently, larger than the previous ones. This is followed by a medium-width section of muted light gray to off-white tones. A thin line of bright white is visible next to this, which leads into more gray and black stripes on the right edge, with a very narrow strip of bright color visible at the far right. Each stripe maintains a vertical alignment across the entire image.
