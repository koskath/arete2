The image consists of a series of vertical stripes extending across its entirety. The stripes vary in width and color, creating a pattern from left to right. Starting from the left edge, there is a thin, light blue stripe that tilts slightly. Next to it is a wider dark green stripe, followed by a lighter green stripe.

Adjacent to these stripes, a sequence of very narrow stripes displays a mix of dark green and grey tones. Toward the center, there is a broader grey stripe flanked by darker boundaries. Near the center, a prominent bright blue stripe stands out, which is directly next to a dark brown stripe.

Along the right side of the image, there are further narrow bands that transition from dark brown to shades of grey and a few more subtle green hues, ending with another tilted blue stripe on the extreme right edge. These stripes together form a distorted vertical pattern, suggesting a visually continuous image that has been stretched or blurred horizontally.
