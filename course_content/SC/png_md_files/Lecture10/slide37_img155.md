The image consists of a rectangular composition divided into two main sections. The left portion features a series of vertical lines in varying shades of blue, gray, black, and a hint of purple, which are closely spaced and create a gradient effect. These lines range in thickness and color density, transitioning gradually across the section. The right portion is dominated by a solid, deep blue area that occupies approximately half of the total width of the image. The transition between the left vertical line section and the solid blue section appears smooth and continuous. No other structures, annotations, or elements are present in the image. The borders of the image are straight, and the overall composition forms a symmetrical and balanced division between the two sections.
