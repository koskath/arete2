The image consists of numerous vertical bands of varying colors and widths running from top to bottom. On the left side, there are thin vertical bands in olive green and cream shades. As we move towards the center, the bands increase in width and range in color from dark green to shades of gray and blue. In the central and right sections, the colors become predominantly blue, with a significant wide band of vivid blue occupying much of the rightmost side of the image. The bands have smooth edges and transition seamlessly into one another, creating a gradient effect from left to right. There are no annotations, text, or additional shapes present in the image.
