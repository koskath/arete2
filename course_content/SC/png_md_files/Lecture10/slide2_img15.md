The image consists of various vertical stripes of different widths and colors, creating a barcode-like pattern across the entire frame. Starting from the left, the first visible stripe is primarily dark gray mixed with faint hints of light gray. To its right, there is a broader stripe in dark green, followed by a series of very narrow alternating stripes in dark gray and lighter gray shades. Moving further to the right, stripes appear in successive colors ranging from muted green to pale olive, transitioning into off-white with nuances of gray, and then to medium gray.

Next, there is a broad block in bright royal blue, sharply contrasting with the preceding neutral tones. Adjacent to the blue stripe, there are darker brown and grayish-brown sections that appear uneven in width. Towards the far right, the sequence ends with varying thicknesses of narrow stripes in similar brown and gray tonalities, completing the gradient effect of colored stripes that extend throughout the entirety of the image.
