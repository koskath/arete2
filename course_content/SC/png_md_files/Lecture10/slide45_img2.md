The image contains handwritten blue text on a white background. The text is organized in a list format with four bullet points, each beginning with a hyphen:

1. The first line reads "BUYING OWN CONTAINERS" with the word "CONTAINERS" underlined. To the right of this line, encased within parentheses, is the text "(SOC)".

2. The second line states "STH FROM SOC" with a scribble or correction mark on the second word.

3. The third line says "LEASE CONTAINERS".

4. The fourth line reads "PAY AMEND!" with an underline below the entire line.

The handwriting is cursive and somewhat stylized, with varying letter sizes and angles. The lines are spaced to provide separation between each point.
