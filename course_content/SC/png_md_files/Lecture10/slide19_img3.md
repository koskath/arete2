The image contains the following elements:

1. **Text:**
   - The phrase "Transport Mode and Lead Times" is prominently displayed in large, bold blue font at the top left.
   - Below this, there is a smaller black text partially visible, beginning with "Lead times are closely related to decisions on transport mode."

2. **Logo:**
   - To the right of the main text, there is a logo consisting of a blue square with the letters "CBS" in white.
   - Next to the logo, the words "COPENHAGEN BUSINESS SCHOOL HANDELSHØJSKOLEN" are written in blue.

3. **Red Hand-drawn Scribble:**
   - There's a series of red lines and scribbles over the image.
   - The scribble begins from the top center, with lines diverging in multiple directions.
   - A main vertical line connects a horizontal line, forming a distorted cross shape.
   - A looped, circular scribble is positioned to the top right within the overall red markings.
   - Within the loop, a smaller text-like scribble resembling "RSV" is visible, though the writing is abstract and not clearly defined.
   - Additional lines are drawn outwards, overlapping the text and logo.

Overall, the elements are laid out horizontally with the primary text to the left, the CBS logo and associated text to the right, and red scribbles sprawling across the center and right sections of the image.
