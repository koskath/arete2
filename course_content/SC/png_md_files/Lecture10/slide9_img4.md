The image contains several transportation-related illustrations and elements arranged horizontally. 

1. **Left Section**:
   - A red truck with two visible axles at the back and one axle at the front. The cargo area contains two stacked yellow rectangular containers.

2. **Middle Left and Middle Right Sections**:
   - Two blue gantry cranes, one positioned to the left and the other to the right of the central elements. Each crane has a yellow rectangular container suspended below them through black lines resembling cables.

3. **Central Section**:
   - At the top, there's a blue ship outlined with a flat bottom. On the deck of the ship, there are six yellow rectangular containers. The ship has a few circular windows or portholes drawn near the front.
   - Below the ship, there is a grey barge with a flat base. It carries four yellow rectangular containers. The barge has two triangular structures on its deck, resembling supports or cranes.
   - At the bottom, there is a train consisting of a red locomotive with two wheels and two yellow rectangular containers attached behind it. The train's track is depicted with smaller, black, circular wheels underneath the containers.

4. **Right Section**:
   - Another red truck, similar to the one on the left, with two yellow rectangular containers in its cargo area.

The overall design arranges these elements to visually represent different nodes and methods of cargo transportation across the supply chain. The trucks on the sides, the ship and barge in the center, and the crane operations all suggest stages of loading and transporting cargo.
