The image is divided into two horizontal sections by a thick black line, with additional text labels and graphical elements in each section. 

In the upper section:

- Three distinct segments are labeled "Pre-Carriage," "Ro/Ro-Ferry or Rolling Road," and "Onward Carriage."
- In the "Pre-Carriage" segment on the left, there is an illustration of a truck with a yellow cargo container mounted on a trailer. The truck has a red cabin and is shown on black wheels.
- In the "Ro/Ro-Ferry or Rolling Road" segment in the middle, a similar truck and trailer are depicted, followed by a red locomotive with multiple black wheels. This indicates the transfer of cargo via another transport mode.
- The "Onward Carriage" segment on the right contains another image of a red locomotive hauling a trailer with a yellow cargo container, similar to earlier sections.

In the lower section:

- Two blue vertical rectangular frames are positioned at both ends, with black lines inside them, suggesting mechanisms for loading or support.
- Within the left blue frame, a truck and trailer with a yellow cargo container are lifted, indicated by black lines resembling lifting gear or hooks.
- Between the blue frames, to the right, a graphic shows a red locomotive followed by a trailer carrying a yellow cargo container, similar to the image above in the "Ro/Ro-Ferry or Rolling Road" segment.
- The right blue frame mirrors the left one, depicting the unloading or handling of a similar truck with a yellow cargo container.

Overall, the image illustrates a multi-modal transportation process, showing different stages and mechanisms involved in moving cargo using trucks and trains.
