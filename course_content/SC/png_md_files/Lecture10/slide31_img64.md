The image is a flowchart representing a hierarchical process with three levels.

- **Top Level:**

  - There is a rectangle labeled "Supplier." It is positioned at the top center of the image.

- **Middle Level:**

  - Directly below the "Supplier" rectangle, there is a rectangle labeled "Manufacturer."
  - The "Manufacturer" rectangle is connected to the "Supplier" rectangle above it by a straight vertical arrow.

- **Bottom Level:**

  - Directly below the "Manufacturer" rectangle, there is a rectangle labeled "Customer."
  - The "Customer" rectangle is connected to the "Manufacturer" rectangle above it by a straight vertical arrow.

The layout is linear, with each entity having a single connection to the one directly above or below it. All rectangles are aligned centrally on the vertical axis.
