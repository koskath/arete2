The image consists of a narrow vertical strip with a series of blurred, vertically elongated shapes. Starting from the left, there is a predominantly light area with a very narrow band of gradient shades ranging from light gray to off-white, decreasing to a sharp point as it moves downwards. This is followed by a wider section that contains multiple muted tones including light gray, silver, beige, and grayish-brown, each transitioning smoothly into the next. It appears as a distorted reflection or a metal-like surface. Further right, there is a vibrant blue band containing multiple shades, suggesting a solid or painted surface. Towards the extreme right, there are brown, beige, and tan tones with indistinct lines and shapes, with one diagonal blue line running towards the bottom right corner. The vertical arrangement and blurring of the sections create a sense of depth and distortion across the image.
