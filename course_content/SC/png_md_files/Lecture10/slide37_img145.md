The image consists of vertical lines and bands predominantly in shades of blue. On the left side, there is a dense concentration of narrow vertical lines with a complex blend of blues, ranging from light to dark. These lines are closely packed, giving the appearance of a textured gradient. As the lines progress to the right, they widen and become fewer, merging into larger vertical bands of blue. The largest band is a solid, deep blue, occupying the majority of the right portion of the image. There are no other visible structures, shapes, annotations, or details. The background appears to be white, enhancing the contrast with the blue elements.
