The image features a flowchart illustrating a supply chain process with multiple steps and timelines. It consists of horizontal and vertical rectangular bars, lines, and annotations organized into a structured diagram. Below are detailed descriptions of each component:

1. **Text on the Left:**
   - "Booking in system" is aligned with the top of the first bar.
   - "Arrival store USA" aligns with the second bar.
   - "Arrival port (C)" aligns with the next set of bars.
   - "Sailing" is aligned with the third vertical bar.
   - "Departure port Taiwan" aligns with the fourth bar.
   - "Departure factory (B)" aligns with the bottommost bar.

2. **Main Vertical Sequence (Left Column):**
   - Horizontal dashed lines connect components at different stages.
   - Top-left: Small horizontal bar, labeled "3," with hatched pattern.
   
3. **Horizontal Bar Cluster (Centered):**
   - Above the cluster, the numeral "26*" is indicated.
   - The primary vertical bar runs lower than the other blocks, divided by the sequence:
     - "3" at the top (white bar with text).
     - "13" underneath (striped vertically, text in the center).
     - "7" below that (patterned hatched, text in the center).
   
4. **Horizontal Components:**
   - To the right, separate horizontal bars:
     - Small hatched bar labeled "14."
     - Small solid bar labeled "12" horizontally aligned next to "14."

5. **Vertical Main Section (Right Column):**
   - Large vertical bar labeled "18" positioned further right than the main cluster.

6. **Extended Horizontal Components (Far Right):**
   - Top bar labeled "4" has a crossed pattern.
   - A smaller bar next to it labeled "2."

7. **Annotations at the Bottom Right:**
   - Rectangular box lists:
     - "Minimum 17 days"
     - "Average 26 days"
     - "Maximum 50 days"

8. **General Notes:**
   - The diagram uses various patterns for differentiation like hatching, crossing, and vertical stripes.
   - The asterisk next to "26" indicates a footnote: "* values in calendar days."

Each component reflects the timing and structure of steps in a supply chain process, likely associated with shipping and logistics across different locations.
