The image is composed of a series of vertical stripes that occupy the entire frame. On the left side, the stripes are narrow, closely packed, and consist of a range of colors, including muted greens, grays, and blacks. These stripes blend into the central section where the width of the stripes increases and the colors transition to a mix of dark green, black, and hints of blue. To the right side of the image, the stripes become wider, and the colors predominantly shift to a deep, solid blue, occupying a significant portion of the right side. The transition between these sections is smooth, with no harsh separations between the different colored areas. The blue section also has slight variations in shading, creating a gradual tonal change across the stripe. The overall effect is a gradient-like transition from a mix of greens and grays on the left to a solid blue on the right.
