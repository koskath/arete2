The image shows a pattern of vertical lines in varying shades of blue and white. The lines are close together on the left side and gradually become fewer and wider apart as they move to the right. The lines appear to be parallel, creating a gradient effect from dense to sparse. The background is white, and there are no additional shapes, annotations, or structures. The intensity of the blue color varies, with darker blues interspersed among lighter shades, contributing to a sense of depth and texture.
