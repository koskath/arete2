The image contains a symmetrical, abstract shape entirely filled with a solid color of light coral pink. The shape resembles a parallelogram but is irregular, with five distinct edges. The top edge is horizontal and slightly longer than the bottom edge. Both left and right sides are straight and vertical, and they extend down from the top edge, but the right side is slightly shorter than the left. The bottom edge connects the left side to the right side through an angled, downward slanting line that transitions back upwards to meet the right side, forming a trapezoidal form with an inward notch at the bottom center. The shape does not contain any text, annotations, or additional details. The background is completely white.
