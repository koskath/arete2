The image contains a flowchart with boxes, arrows, and annotations showing relationships between different entities involved in a shipping process. Here are the details:

1. **Boxes with Labels**:
   - "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)" enclosed in a rounded rectangle, positioned at the top left.
   - "Exporter, Shipper" in a rounded rectangle, located at the bottom left.
   - "Railway Terminal" in a rounded rectangle, to the right of "Exporter, Shipper."
   - "Railway Operator" in a rounded rectangle, to the right of "Railway Terminal."
   - "Terminal at Seaport" in a rounded rectangle, to the right of "Railway Operator."
   - "Container" label is partially visible beneath the "Terminal at Seaport" box.
   - "Ocean Carrier" in a rounded rectangle, positioned at the top right.

2. **Arrows and Lines**:
   - A blue arrow starts at "Exporter, Shipper," curves left and then right, connecting to "Railway Terminal."
   - From "Railway Terminal," a blue arrow proceeds horizontally to "Railway Operator," then continues to "Terminal at Seaport," and finally reaches "Ocean Carrier."
   - A red line labeled "Alternative flows" originates from the top of the "Exporter, Shipper" box and curves upward to connect with the "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)" box. It continues with an arc from "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)" over the top of the diagram, terminating at the "Container" area beneath "Terminal at Seaport."

3. **Annotations**:
   - The phrase "Alternative flows" is written in blue near the middle-top of the image, accompanied by a red wavy line and arrow pointing towards the red lines connecting various entities.

4. **Additional Red Arcs**:
   - There are several curved red lines around "Freight Forwarder (Jessica)" emanating outward, suggesting emphasis or alternative routes.
   - A red line also extends laterally from "Terminal at Seaport" to the left, reaching "Ocean Carrier."

The layout suggests a transportation and logistics operation flow, with emphasis on different routing possibilities, including alternatives highlighted in red.
