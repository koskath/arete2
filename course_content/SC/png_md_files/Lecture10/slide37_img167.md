The image consists of a series of vertical stripes that vary in color and width, extending from the top to the bottom. On the left side, the stripes are predominantly dark, ranging from black to very dark blue. As you move from left to right, the stripes gradually transition through various shades of blue, becoming lighter and brighter. The leftmost portion has narrow stripes with subtle gradations between black, dark gray, and very dark blue. Toward the center, the stripes slightly widen and display more discernible dark blue tones. On the far right side, the stripes are uniformly bright blue and occupy a larger portion, creating a consistent thick stripe that dominates this area. There are no visible annotations, labels, or any textual elements present within the image.
