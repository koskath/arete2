The image is a graph with the horizontal axis labeled in three sections: "100% surface, 0% air" on the leftmost section underlined with a blue rectangle containing white text, "Mixture of surface and air" in the middle, and "0% surface, 100% air" on the rightmost section also underlined with a blue rectangle containing white text. Below the horizontal axis, under the left section, is the label “'Surface captive'”. Below the right section is the annotation “‘Air captive’ commodities that cannot tolerate the transit time of surface transport.”

The vertical axis is labeled “Cost per year” with text oriented vertically. 

Three curves are depicted on the graph:

1. The blue curve labeled “Transport-related cost¹” begins at a low point on the left and curves upwards as it moves to the right, illustrating an increasing trend.
2. The red dashed curve labeled “Inventory-related cost²” starts higher on the left and curves downward steeply, showing a decreasing trend as it moves right.
3. The yellow curve labeled “Total distribution cost (TDC)³” begins at a moderate level on the left, curves downward, and then slightly upward, forming a gentle U-shape. 

At the lowest point of the yellow curve, there is a circle with a label “Minimum TDC” and a black arrow pointing from the label to the circle. 

The graph visually represents the relationship between different transportation strategies (surface vs. air) and their related costs, with the intersection and trends of the curves indicating the trade-offs between transport-related and inventory-related costs.
