The image consists of three distinct sections of text and an arrow diagram:

1. **Top Section**: 
   - The left side reads, "commodities that can never bear the cost of air transport (i.e., grain, crude oil, etc)."
   - The right side reads, "that cannot tolerate the transit time of surface transport (i.e., certain high-value perishables, hot-selling toys, etc)."

2. **Middle Section**:
   - Centered between the two text sections, there is an arrow pointing to the right.
   - Above the arrow, the text reads, "transportation service."
   - Below the arrow, it reads, "Greater speed and reliability."

3. **Bottom Section**:
   - A footnote-style list with three numbered entries:
     - "¹ Transport Related Costs reflect all costs associated with moving goods, including freight bills, documentation, customs brokerage, etc."
     - "² Inventory Related Costs include all other elements of logistics costs—from storing and handling product to write-downs of obsolete or spoiled goods."
     - "³ Total Distribution Cost = Transport-Related Cost + Inventory-Related Cost."

The overall layout juxtaposes two types of commodities and their relation to transport costs with an explanatory note on related costs at the bottom.
