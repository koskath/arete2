The image shows a graph with annotated lines, shaded areas, and labels. The graph has:

- **Title**: At the top, there is the word “Concept” in large blue letters.
- **Axes**:
  - The vertical axis is labeled "Cost per year."
  - The horizontal axis is labeled "Transportation service."
- **Lines and Curves**:
  - A blue line labeled "Transport-related cost" starts at the bottom left and curves upward to the right.
  - A red dashed line labeled "Inventory-related cost?" starts at the top left and curves downward to the right.
  - A yellow line labeled "Total distribution cost (TDC)" curves downward, reaches a minimum point in the center, and then curves upward slightly.
  - Two red lines intersect across the image, forming an "X" shape. These lines are hand-drawn and cover areas of the graph.
- **Annotations**:
  - At the intersection of the yellow and red dashed line, there is a circled point with an arrow pointing to it labeled "Minimum TDC."
  - Below the horizontal axis, three boxed labels indicate categories:
    - Left: "100% surface, 0% air" with the subtitle “Surface captive”
    - Center: "Mixture of surface and air"
    - Right: "0% surface, 100% air" with the subtitle “Air captive”
- **Hand-Drawn Annotations**:
  - "SFA" is written in red near the "100% surface, 0% air" label.
  - "AIR" is written in red near the "0% surface, 100% air" label.
  - A large red circle encompasses part of the graph at the top center with an arrow and handwritten text, although the text is partially obscured.
- **Source**: At the bottom right, oriented vertically, the source is noted as "Source: Meredith et al. (2008)." 

Overall, the graph shows the relationship between different components of cost and transportation service mix, with various annotations and curves depicting theoretical changes as transportation methods change.
