The image is a horizontal bar graph with the following features:

- **Axes**: 
  - The vertical axis on the left is labeled with numbers: 5,000 and 10,000, with increments likely representing quantity or cost.
  - The horizontal axis at the bottom is labeled as "Transit Time (days)" with tick marks labeled: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, marking days.

- **Data Representations**:
  - There are two green circles labeled "Rail" and "Rail*" positioned at approximately 15 and 35 days respectively on the horizontal axis.
  - Two blue circles labeled "Sea" and "Sea*" are positioned at approximately 25 and 30 days respectively on the horizontal axis.
  
- **Rectangles and Arrows**:
  - A horizontal thick yellow rectangle spans from the beginning of the first "Rail" circle at 15 days to about 35 days, ending at the "Rail*" circle.
  - Thin orange arrows point from "Rail" to "Rail*" and from "Sea" to "Sea*".
  
- **Red Annotations**:
  - Red hand-drawn annotations are present throughout the image.
  - A large red "X" is drawn over a small section in the lower left corner, with two zeros on either side.
  - Red lines and scribbles encircle and cross over the labeled circles and the yellow rectangle.
  - Curved red lines connect the circles and extend from them.

No grid lines or additional data points are present. The background is white, and the labels are written in a standard sans-serif font.
