The image contains a series of vertical blue lines of varying thicknesses against a white background. The lines exhibit a gradient from dark blue to light blue and appear to have streaks or blurs. Toward the top-right corner, some of the blue lines are angled, slanting towards the right side of the image. At the top-left corner, there are parts of two light blue lines that are narrower and parallel to each other. The bottom part contains partially visible, blurry, blue text slanted diagonally from bottom left to top right. Visible letters include portions of "EXAMIN" at the top right and "le" at the bottom right, along with partial letters "ub" in the middle; however, the text is unreadable in its entirety. The overall composition seems abstract with no other distinctive elements.
