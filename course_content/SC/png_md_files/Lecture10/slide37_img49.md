The image appears to show a series of closely arranged, curved vertical lines in varying shades of blue. These lines are situated on a white background, creating a striped pattern. The lines themselves are smooth, with varying thicknesses, and appear to undulate slightly, giving a sense of movement or flow from top to bottom. The lines are primarily concentrated on the left side of the image, gradually dispersing as they move to the right, leaving a clear white space on the right side of the image. There is no other visible structure, annotation, or text within this section of the image.
