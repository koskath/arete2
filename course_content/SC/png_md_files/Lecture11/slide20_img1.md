The image displays a layered area chart divided into three distinct sections, labeled “Surge Flow Inventory,” “Wave Flow Inventory,” and “Base Flow Inventory” from top to bottom. 

1. **Base Flow Inventory**: 
   - Positioned at the bottom of the chart.
   - Presented as a solid, continuous band with no fluctuations.

2. **Wave Flow Inventory**:
   - Placed directly above the Base Flow Inventory.
   - Shown as a wavy band with moderate fluctuations in height.

3. **Surge Flow Inventory**:
   - Located at the topmost part.
   - Characterized by a high degree of fluctuation creating a zig-zag pattern.
   - Peaks and troughs vary significantly, forming a series of sharp, triangular waves.

**Axes and Labels**:

- The y-axis on the left is labeled “Inventory Holding $”.
- The x-axis at the bottom is labeled “Time”.

**Legend**: 
- Located on the right side of the chart.
- Contains three categories with checkboxes:
  - A blank checkbox labeled “Fad products”.
  - A checkbox with diagonal lines, labeled “Seasonal fashion products”.
  - A filled checkbox, labeled “Core business products”.

The entire chart, including axes and legend, has a white outline against a black background. The layers of inventory are distinct from each other with text annotations, and the wave patterns indicate variability over time.
