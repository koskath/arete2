The image shows a wooden crate with an open top, sitting on a wooden pallet. The crate is painted orange and has cut-out handles on its sides. Inside the crate, there are blue rectangular and irregularly shaped objects. On the exterior of the crate's front side, there is a large white label attached to the left, outlined in blue. A smaller white label is to the right of the large one, marked "B546." In the background, there are shelves or cabinets, predominantly red, and another structure that appears to have storage capability, with visible labels on it. The floor is light-colored, possibly concrete. The crate and pallet are positioned in a warehouse-like environment.
