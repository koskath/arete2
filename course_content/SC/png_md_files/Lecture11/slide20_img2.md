The image is a table with three columns: "Type," "Characteristics," and "Stockholding policy." There are four rows underneath the headers, each detailing different flow types and their corresponding characteristics and policies. 

1. **Type: "Base flow"**
   - **Characteristics:** "Predictable high flow rates."
   - **Stockholding policy:** "Minimum stocks. Direct deliveries from suppliers."

2. **Type: "Wave flow"**
   - **Characteristics:** "Slow moving flow rates. High criticality. Perishable. Peaks are relatively predictable."
   - **Stockholding policy:** "Minimise stockholding, building them during peak demand period. Direct delivery from supplier where possible."

3. **Type: "Surge flow (1)"**
   - **Characteristics:** "High criticality. Low value. Long lead time. Small physical size."
   - **Stockholding policy:** "Hold high level of stock thereby allowing safety stock delivery lead time and demand fluctuations."

4. **Type: "Surge flow (2)"**
   - **Characteristics:** "Low criticality. High value. Bulky physical characteristics. Peaks are relatively predictable."
   - **Stockholding policy:** "Minimise stockholding, building them only during peak demand period. Direct delivery from supplier where possible."
