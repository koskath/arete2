The image shows the entrance of an "Amazon Go" store. The main feature is a large black panel on the left side with the text "amazon go" written in all lowercase near the upper left corner. The word "amazon" is in white, followed by a curved arrow resembling a smile, also in white. The word "go" is situated to the right of the smile, also in white.

Below the "amazon go" logo, the black panel is decorated with a pattern of yellow, orange, and white dots that decrease in density towards the bottom. The panel is mounted on a wooden wall to the left.

To the right, the entrance to the store is visible with a partially glass-covered entrance area showing shelves stocked with products inside. A person carrying a backpack is walking out of the store, heading towards the right side of the image. 

In the foreground, there is a sign with an orange top and white text that reads "BETA" followed by smaller text that is not fully legible. This sign is placed on a sidewalk in front of the store. 

A tree with green leaves partially overhangs the scene along the top right, and the glass-covered area extends along the sidewalk with a row of leafy trees mirrored on the right, suggesting an urban setting.
