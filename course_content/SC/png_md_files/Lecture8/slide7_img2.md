At the center top of the image, there is a rectangular box with the text:

"External shock: COVID-19
- More working at home
- Health concern
- Temporary closure of stores"

From this central box, two arrows extend downwards. 

1. **Left Side (Orange Arrows):**

   - A blue arrow points downward to the text "More shopping online."
   - An orange arrow curves from "More shopping online" to "Improved profitability and cash."
   - Another orange arrow curves from "Improved profitability and cash" to "Higher market capitalization."
   - A final orange arrow curves from "Higher market capitalization" back to "More shopping online."

   Beneath "More shopping online," it says, "Improved capacity, quality and availability.”

2. **Right Side (Blue Arrows):**

   - A blue arrow points downward to the text "Less shopping offline."
   - A blue arrow curves from "Less shopping offline" to "Weakened revenues and performance of physical stores."
   - Another blue arrow curves from "Weakened revenues and performance of physical stores" to "Lower market capitalization."
   - A final blue arrow curves from "Lower market capitalization" back to "Long term deterioration of store."

   Beneath "Less shopping offline," it says, "Long term deterioration of store."
