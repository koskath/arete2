The image consists of a logo. On the left side, there is an orange shape resembling a rounded triangle oriented with its base down and a corner pointing upwards to the right. To the right of this shape, the word "zalando" is written in lowercase letters. The text is in a modern sans-serif font and is colored black. The letters are evenly spaced, and the design is clean and minimalistic. The spacing between the orange shape and the text is moderate, keeping both elements visually connected yet distinct.
