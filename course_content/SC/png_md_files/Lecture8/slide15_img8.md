The image consists of a white background with multiple vertical black stripes varying in thickness. These stripes are dispersed across the image with spaces of different widths between them. On the right side, partially visible, there are black, slightly blurred letters resembling "KEOWN" or similar. To the far right, there is a partial section of the letters "CN2" visible in black. The left side of the image features a gray narrow vertical band. The stripes fade towards the top of the image, creating a tapered effect above the text. The overall composition is abstract and minimalistic.
