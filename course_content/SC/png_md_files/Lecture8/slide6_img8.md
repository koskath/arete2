A bold black curved line forms a semi-circle on the left side. Directly above are two small black circles, evenly spaced, resembling eyes. These elements combine to create a smiley face inside a solid yellow square with rounded corners. Immediately to the right of the square is the word "Gearbest." The "G" is uppercase, while the rest of the letters are lowercase. The text is in a bold, black, rounded font with equal spacing between each character. The letters are evenly aligned in a straight horizontal line. The yellow square and the text are on a white background.
