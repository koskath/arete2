The image shows a horizontal white gradient on a light gray background. On the left side, the gradient begins with a more pronounced white area along the vertical edge that gradually fades into the light gray as it extends to the right. The gradient effect is more visible near the left edge and becomes less distinct as it moves horizontally across the image. There are no distinct shapes, annotations, structures, or additional elements present in the image.
