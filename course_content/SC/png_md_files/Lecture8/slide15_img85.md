The image features a predominantly white background with a diagonal gradient band extending from the top left to the bottom right corner. The gradient starts as a light grey on the left edge, becoming darker as it moves to the right, culminating in a black triangle-like shape at the top right corner. This gradient band has soft, blurred edges, blending smoothly into the surrounding white area. The transition from grey to black in the gradient is smooth, with the darker area being about one-third the width of the image, suggesting a subtle shading effect. Other than this gradient, the image is void of any additional elements, structures, or annotations.
