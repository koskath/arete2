The image features two prominent elongated shapes on a white background. 

On the left side, there is a vertical shape composed of many thin, closely spaced, vertical lines in various shades of gray, creating a blurred and streaked effect. The lines vary in intensity from black to light gray, forming a vertical gradient with a dominant middle section that appears darker.

On the right side, there is a singular elongated shape that is diagonal, extending from the top left to the bottom right. This shape is smooth, with a consistent width, and exhibits a gradient from dark gray at the bottom to medium gray at the top.

Both shapes have a soft, diffused border giving a sense of motion or speed. The background is plain white, providing contrast to the gray-toned elements. There are no additional markings, annotations, or structures visible in the image.
