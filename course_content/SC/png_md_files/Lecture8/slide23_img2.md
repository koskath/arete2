The image features a horizontal chain of five overlapping ovals, each representing a distinct stage in a manufacturing supply chain. The ovals from left to right are labeled "Supplier," "Manufacturer," "Distributor," "Retailer," and "Consumer." Each label is centered within its respective oval.

Above the chain of ovals, two horizontal double-headed arrows span the entire length of the diagram. The top arrow is labeled "Materials" and points in both the left and right directions.

Below the chain, another horizontal double-headed arrow is also present and spans the entire length of the diagram. This bottom arrow is labeled "Data and Resources" and also points in both left and right directions.

In the top right corner of the image, outside the chain, there is a label "(a) Manufacturing supply chain."

The design reflects a flowchart-like structure both visually and conceptually, with the overlapping ovals suggesting a sequence or connection between the different stages of the supply chain.
