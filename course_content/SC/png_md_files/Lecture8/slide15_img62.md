A pair of parallel, diagonal dark lines are seen on the left side of the image, with a gradient that fades from dark to light as it moves outward. On the right side, several vertical streaks of varying darkness appear, with a smooth gradient transitioning to lighter tones on either side. The background consists of a light gray expanse with a subtle gradient transitioning into white towards the bottom right corner. The elements create a series of overlaying transparent effects throughout the image.
