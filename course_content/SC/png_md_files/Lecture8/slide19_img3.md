The image consists of a logo with two main elements: a graphic icon and text. 

On the left side, there is a square-shaped icon with rounded corners, colored in teal. Within this square, there are four white diagonal lines that intersect, creating geometric shapes reminiscent of streets or pathways.

To the right of the icon, the text "DriveNow" is displayed. "Drive" is in black, and "Now" is in teal. The text is sans-serif, with consistent thickness and clear, bold lettering.

The icon and text are aligned horizontally, with the icon slightly shorter than the height of the text. The design is clean and minimalist, with no additional elements, backgrounds, or embellishments.
