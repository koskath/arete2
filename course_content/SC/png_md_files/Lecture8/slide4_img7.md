The image consists of a logo with two main components. 

1. The top part:
   - Contains large black uppercase letters "M & S".
   - The letters are bold and appear in a sans-serif typeface.
   - The ampersand "&" is styled similarly, connecting the "M" and "S" at the midpoint.
   - There is consistent spacing between the letters and the ampersand.

2. The bottom part:
   - Below the "M & S", there is smaller text reading "EST. 1884".
   - This text is also in black and utilizes a sans-serif typeface consistent with the top part.
   - The letters are evenly spaced, with a period after "EST".

The overall layout positions the "M & S" directly above the "EST. 1884", creating a vertically centered alignment. The text is on a white background with no additional graphics or elements present.
