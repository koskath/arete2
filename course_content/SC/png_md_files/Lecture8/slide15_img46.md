The image contains three vertical, evenly spaced, parallel black lines. The lines are of equal length and thickness. There is a symmetrical composition, with two lines on the right side of the image and one line on the left side. The background is a solid pale gray. The left and right portions of the image appear to have faint vertical gradients suggesting a beveled or three-dimensional surface running along the sides. The overall composition is minimalistic.
