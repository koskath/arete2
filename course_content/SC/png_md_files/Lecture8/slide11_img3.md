The image contains a horizontal bar chart and two textual captions. 

1. **Bar Chart:**
   - It consists of three horizontal bars of varying lengths representing different data metrics, colored in gray.
   - The top bar is labeled "Percentage of e-commerce consumers abroad," with a value of "71%" shown at the end of the bar.
   - The middle bar is labeled "Percentage of e-commerce consumers," with a value of "88%" shown at the end of the bar.
   - The bottom bar is labeled "Internet penetration," with a value of "99%" shown at the end of the bar.
   - Each label is placed to the left of the corresponding bar, and the percentage value is placed to the right, outside the end of each bar.

2. **Textual Captions:**
   - Below the bar chart, there are two sections of text in bold:
     - Left section: "Percentage of e-commerce consumers who have made purchases from each respective product category over the past year."
     - Right section: "From which of the following e-commerce sites have you shopped online in the past year?" 

The layout shows that the bar chart is placed above the two textual captions.
