The image consists of a circular green logo with the words "THE BODY SHOP" in capital letters at the center. Each word is stacked vertically, with "THE" at the top, "BODY" in the middle, and "SHOP" at the bottom. Surrounding the text, the circular design has two green curved lines positioned symmetrically on the left and right sides, resembling stylized, incomplete parentheses or arcs. Below the arc on the right side, there is a small "TM" symbol indicating a trademark. The entire logo is set against a white background.
