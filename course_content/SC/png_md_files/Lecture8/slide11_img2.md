The image contains a horizontal bar chart titled "Percentage of e-commerce consumers that have shopped from abroad." The title is written at the top in large, bold letters.

Below the title are three categories, each aligned to the left:

1. "Percentage who shopped online more often due to coronavirus"
2. "Average purchase per month (EUR)"
3. "Percentage of e-commerce consumers abroad"

To the right of each category label, there are horizontal bars representing data, aligned with corresponding percentage or currency values:

- The first category "Percentage who shopped online more often due to coronavirus" has a grey horizontal bar. Beside this bar on the right is the percentage "28%." A dashed vertical line extends upwards from this percentage point.

- The second category "Average purchase per month (EUR)" also has a grey horizontal bar longer than the first one. On the right, it annotates with "EUR 243." A dashed vertical line runs upwards from this annotation.

- The third category "Percentage of e-commerce consumers abroad" features a grey horizontal bar longer than the first but shorter than the second. To the right, it notes "71%." Below this percentage, a dashed vertical line extends upwards.

Each category description and bar have a uniform spacing. The bars run from left to right, parallel to the respective category labels. The top of the graph is marked with the label "Agerage for Europe," with a horizontal line extending across the image.
