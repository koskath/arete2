The image contains the word "eBay" written in a playful, overlapping style, with each letter a different color. The letter "e" is large and red, positioned on the far left. The letter "b" is blue and overlaps with the "e" on its left side. The letter "a" is yellow, positioned to the right of the "b," with a portion overlapping the blue "b." The letter "Y" is green, placed at the end, overlapping the yellow "a" slightly. The letters are stylized, rounded, and have different formations where they overlap, creating blended color effects. There is a small registered trademark symbol, ®, located to the upper right of the "Y."
