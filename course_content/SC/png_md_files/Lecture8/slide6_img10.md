The image consists of two main textual elements. 

1. The top portion features the word "PROSHOP" in bold, red, uppercase letters. The font is modern and sans-serif. Each letter is connected with a consistent thickness of lines. The "O" in "PROSHOP" contains a small registered trademark symbol "®" located at its top-right corner in a smaller font size.

2. Below "PROSHOP," there is a line of text with two segments. The text is in a bold, uppercase sans-serif font, colored in black. The first segment reads "MEGET MERE," followed by a forward-pointing chevron ">" symbol. There is a space before the second segment, which reads "MEGET HURTIGERE," followed by another forward-pointing chevron ">" symbol. The text segments are aligned centrally beneath the word "PROSHOP."

The background of the image is white, providing strong contrast with the red and black text for high visibility.
