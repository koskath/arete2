The image features a blue logo above the word "Free2move." The logo consists of a series of circular shapes and arcs:

1. At the center, there is a complete small circle.
2. Surrounding the small circle, there are three separate curved lines, forming almost complete concentric circles, but with noticeable gaps between each section.
   - The innermost arc is located at the top left of the central circle.
   - The middle arc is positioned at the bottom right of the central circle.
   - The outermost arc is situated at the bottom left of the configuration.
   
Below this logo, the word "Free2move" is written in a stylized, rounded lowercase blue font. The number "2" is distinctly styled to blend in with the letters while still being recognizable as a numeral. The entire arrangement is centered with equal spacing around the components. The color scheme is solely composed of different shades of blue against a white background.
