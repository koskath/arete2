The image contains a logo composed of text and symbols on a white background. The focal point is the word "PLUUS" in bold, uppercase letters, predominantly black in color but with a design element: the first letter "P" is creatively integrated with a red "+" symbol, where the vertical stroke of the "P" and the horizontal line of the "+" are shared, blending together. Below "PLUUS," there is smaller text in uppercase, reading "FORDELSKLUB." This text is in a lighter, more refined font compared to "PLUUS." On both sides of "FORDELSKLUB," there is a small black dot, one on each side, acting as separators. The layers are centered with "PLUUS" occupying the top, dominant portion of the image, and "FORDELSKLUB" situated directly beneath it.
