A horizontal strip with a subtle gradient effect transitioning from light gray at the top to slightly darker gray at the bottom. The strip has a smooth texture and spans the entire width of the image. There are no visible annotations, shapes, or additional structures. The strip's edges are somewhat blurred, enhancing the gradient effect. The gradient is uniform across its length, with no distinct lines or divisions. The background appears to be a continuation of the lightest gray shade, providing a seamless look to the strip.
