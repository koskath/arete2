The image contains a logo composed of two main elements: a stylized lowercase letter "a" and the text "alza.cz." 

1. The letter "a":
   - It is in lowercase.
   - The "a" is white and bold.
   - The letter is positioned within a skewed dark blue square background that is tilted slightly counterclockwise.

2. The text "alza.cz":
   - The text is located to the right of the stylized "a."
   - It is in lowercase letters.
   - The word "alza" is in a bold, dark blue font.
   - The "cz" is in a lighter blue font, positioned directly following "alza" without a space.

The overall color scheme of the logo is two shades of blue and white. The elements are horizontally aligned with the "a" slightly elevated compared to the text "alza.cz." The design is simple and uses contrasting colors to ensure visibility.
