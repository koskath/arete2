The image contains a close-up of a section of handwritten text on a white surface. The text appears to be written in black ink and begins with what looks like a partial word that may spell "Glossy". The text is placed in the bottom right corner of the image. Across the image, there are several vertical black and white stripes or bars predominantly on the right side. Additionally, there is a thick, gray diagonal line that runs from the top left to the bottom right, crossing over the stripes. The background is mostly white with some gray shades along the left edge.
