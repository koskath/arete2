The image features three horizontal bar graphs each located in separate horizontal sections. 

The top section is labeled "Zalando" in black text to the left of the bar. To the right of this text, there is a horizontal bar. The bar is visually divided into two parts. The left part of the bar is filled with a bright blue color representing 42%, which is also indicated by "42 %" written inside the blue section in white text. The right part of the bar is unfilled and outlined in blue.

The middle section is labeled "eBay" in black text to the left of the bar. To the right of this text, there is a horizontal bar similarly divided. The left part of this bar is filled with blue representing 22%, as indicated by "22 %" written inside the blue portion in white text. The remaining part of the bar is unfilled and outlined in blue.

The bottom section is labeled "Amazon" in black text to the left of the bar. Adjacent to it is another horizontally oriented bar where the left part is filled with blue, representing 20%, as stated by "20 %" inside the blue area in white text. The rest of the bar is unfilled, also outlined in blue.

All three bars have rounded edges, and the lengths of the blue sections vary according to the percentage they represent, with Zalando having the longest filled section and Amazon the shortest. The bars and text are set on a light gray background.
