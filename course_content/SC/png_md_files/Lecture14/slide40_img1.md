The image is a bar chart titled "THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY'S PROFIT POOL," featuring data from "Gadiesh and Gilbert, Harvard Business Review, May–June 1998." The chart is organized with the vertical axis representing "operating margin" in percentages, ranging from 0% to 25%, and the horizontal axis labeled "Share of Industry Revenue" going from 0% to 100%.

**Components:**

1. **Vertical Axis (Operating Margin):** 
   - Includes percentage markers at intervals of 5, starting at 0 and ending at 25.

2. **Horizontal Axis (Share of Industry Revenue):**
   - Starts at 0% and ends at 100%.

3. **Text Box (Upper-Left Corner):**
   - States: "The automotive industry encompasses many value-chain activities. The way that profits and revenues are distributed among these activities varies greatly. The most profitable areas of the car business are not the ones that generate the biggest revenues."

4. **Bars:**
   - **Auto Manufacturing:** A blue bar reaching approximately 5% operating margin around 5% industry revenue.
   - **New Car Dealers:** A light blue bar ending below the 5% margin.
   - **Used Car Dealers:** A narrow maroon bar with a negligible height.
   - **Auto Loans:** A taller blue bar reaching around 10% margin.
   - **Leasing:** A thin black line extending to just above the 20% margin, the tallest on the chart.
   - **Gasoline:** A narrow red bar with a small height.
   - **Warranty:** A thin green bar with a negligible height.
   - **Auto Insurance:** A purple bar reaching nearly 15% margin.
   - **Service Repair:** A tall blue bar reaching past 10% margin.
   - **Auto Rental:** An orange bar reaching between 15%-20% margin.
   - **Aftermarket Parts:** A shorter orange bar reaching just past 10% margin.

5. **Horizontal Axis Labels (Bottom to Right):**
   - Sequentially accommodate the bars: "auto manufacturing," "new car dealers," "used car dealers," "auto loans," "leasing," "gasoline," "warranty," "auto insurance," "service repair," "auto rental," "aftermarket parts."

The chart illustrates that while some sectors like leasing and auto insurance boast higher operating margins, they have smaller shares of industry revenue, contrasting with sectors like auto manufacturing with lower margins and larger revenue shares.
