The image shows a diagrammatic representation of a portion of a value chain. In the top left corner, the text "Value Added" is displayed vertically. Below this, there is an upward-pointing arrow, indicating a direction along the value-added process.

To the right of the arrow, a sequence of textual components describes different stages and entities involved:

1. "APPLE (US)" is in bold and italicized text, centered at the top of the description.
   Below it, the text: 
   - "Basic and applied" 
   - "R&D, Product Design," 
   - "Commercialization" 

2. Below this, and indented slightly to the right is:
   - "Chip Design," which is in a smaller font and underlined.
   - Directly beneath this is "ARM Holdings (The UK)" in similar formatting.

3. Further down, though partially obscured, the text seems to continue with "Parts – touchscreen." The rest of the text is not fully visible.

On the right side of the image:

1. Another "APPLE (US)" text appears in bold and italicized form. Below this text:
    - "Marketing,"
    - "Brand management"
    - "After-sales services"

Curved, thin lines connect the elements from one side to the other, encapsulating the transition from research and design stages to marketing and after-sales services. The imagery conveys segments of Apple's involvement in various phases of the product lifecycle, emphasizing roles played by different entities and functions.
