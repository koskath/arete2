The black and white image depicts a large, rusted shipwreck resting on a sandy shore. The ship is tilted slightly to the left and partly submerged in shallow water. The hull is visibly corroded, showing patches of lighter and darker areas indicative of rust. On the side of the ship, the word "DIMITRIOS" is faintly visible in capital letters, positioned near the bow.

The ship's superstructure is situated towards the aft section, featuring a multi-level deckhouse with rectangular windows, railing, and a prominent exhaust funnel. A tall mast is visible, with wires extending diagonally to the ship’s structure. There are two smaller structures on the deck, possibly part of the ship's machinery.

In the foreground, the beach reveals wet, uneven sand interspersed with rocky outcrops and small pools of water. On the left side, remnants of other metal debris, including a large, heavily corroded piece, are partially submerged in the water. The horizon is visible in the background, with the sea extending into the distance. Above, the sky is filled with scattered clouds, creating a dramatic backdrop. The overall composition offers a stark contrast between the textures of the rusty metal, rough sand, and smooth water.
