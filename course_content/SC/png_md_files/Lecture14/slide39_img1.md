The image is a diagram illustrating different types of value chain governance, organized into five columns: Market, Modular, Relational, Captive, and Hierarchy. Each column contains specific elements and relationships:

1. **Market Column**:
   - At the top, labeled "Customers," there are five rectangles.
   - An oval labeled "Price" is centered below the rectangles.
   - From the "Price" oval, three arrows point upwards toward the rectangles, and three arrows point downwards toward another set of five rectangles labeled "Suppliers" at the bottom.

2. **Modular Column**:
   - Two rectangles are present: "Lead Firm" at the top and "Full-package Supplier" below it.
   - Between them is a bidirectional connector with arrows curving in opposite directions.
   - Below the "Full-package Supplier" are five rectangles labeled "Component and Material Suppliers," connected by five downward arrows.

3. **Relational Column**:
   - Two rectangles labeled "Lead Firm" at the top and "Relational Supplier" below.
   - A bidirectional arrow connects them vertically.
   - Below "Relational Supplier," five rectangles labeled "Component and Material Suppliers" are connected with five downward arrows.

4. **Captive Column**:
   - A single large rectangle labeled "Lead Firm" at the top.
   - Below it are five rectangles labeled "Captive Suppliers," connected by five downward arrows.

5. **Hierarchy Column**:
   - A tall, narrow rectangle labeled "Integrated Firm."
   - A large, downward arrow spans the height of the rectangle, indicating a unidirectional flow.

**Additional Elements**:
- On the far left, a vertical arrow labeled "Value Chain" points upwards from "Materials" at the bottom to "End Use" at the top.
- Below the main diagram, a horizontal axis labeled "Degree of Explicit Coordination" with "Low" on the left and "High" on the right.
- An aligned parallel axis labeled "Degree of Power Asymmetry."
- The source is provided at the bottom: "Source: Gereffi et al. (2005, p. 89)."
- At the bottom left, the logo and name "COPENHAGEN BUSINESS SCHOOL HANDELSHØJSKOLEN" is displayed, with the letters "CBS" prominently shown.
- The number "39" is located in the bottom right corner.
