The image is divided into two equal vertical halves. 

The left half features the flag of the United States, identifiable by its design elements:
- The upper portion contains a pattern of white stars on a blue rectangle. The visible area includes numerous rows of five-pointed white stars evenly spaced on a blue field.
- The bottom portion consists of alternating red and white horizontal stripes, starting with red at the top and extending to the bottom of the flag.

The right half displays the flag of the European Union:
- A blue field occupies the entire right half.
- On this field, there's a circle of yellow five-pointed stars, with a few stars visible along the curved edge near the center. The stars represent the EU member states in a circular formation.

Centered over the boundary where the two flags meet is a rectangular blackboard with a thin brown frame. The blackboard appears to have a chalk-like texture. On the blackboard, the word "TARIFFS" is written in uppercase, white, hand-drawn letters, slightly slanted and centered horizontally. The blackboard and text obscure parts of both flags where they converge.
