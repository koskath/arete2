The image consists of a diagram with three sections, each illustrating different channel integration strategies, organized from top to bottom. 

1. **Top Section: Manufacturer Integrates Channel**
   - On the left, a light blue rectangle labeled "Manufacturer integrates channel" contains a stylized factory icon.
   - To the right are three blocks labeled "Manufacturer," "LSP," and "Retailer," aligned horizontally.
   - Under "Manufacturer" is a factory icon, under "LSP" are two truck icons, and under "Retailer" are three retail store icons.
   - Solid arrows connect the factory icon to the first truck icon, the first truck icon to the second truck icon, and the second truck icon to the first retail store icon. 
   - Dashed arrows connect the second truck icon to the second and third retail store icons.

2. **Middle Section: Retailer Integrates Channel**
   - On the left, a light blue rectangle labeled "Retailer integrates channel" appears.
   - A series of three factory icons are arranged vertically to the right of this label.
   - Horizontally aligned at the top are blocks for "Manufacturer," "LSP," and "Retailer," similar to the top section.
   - Each factory icon has a solid arrow pointing right to a corresponding truck icon under "LSP."
   - The truck icons are connected by dashed arrows to retail store icons under "Retailer." The first truck connects only to the first retail store, while the second truck connects to the first and second retail stores, and the third truck connects to all three retail stores.

3. **Bottom Section: LSP Integrates Channel**
   - On the left, a light blue rectangle labeled "LSP integrates channel" is displayed.
   - A sequence of four factory icons is aligned vertically to the right of the rectangle.
   - Blocks labeled "Manufacturer," "LSP," and "Retailer" are at the top, with similar alignment to prior sections.
   - Solid arrows lead from each factory icon to the first truck icon under "LSP," the first truck icon to the second truck icon, and the second truck icon branches to the first and second retail store icons, with dashed arrows leading to the third retail store icon.
