The image contains a conceptual diagram featuring three main elements, represented as ovals, with associated text and arrows indicating relationships:

1. **Left Oval:**
   - Contains three bullet points with text:
     - "• Advanced economies"
     - "• Services"
     - "• Intangibles"
   - Positioned towards the top left corner of the image.

2. **Right Oval:**
   - Contains three bullet points with text:
     - "• Services"
     - "• Advanced economies"
     - "• Intangibles"
   - Positioned towards the top right corner of the image.

3. **Bottom Oval:**
   - Contains one bullet point with text:
     - "• Emerging market economies"
   - Positioned in the bottom center of the image.

4. **Arrows and Text:**
   - Two large curved arrows pointing upwards from the bottom oval to each of the top ovals.
   - Two smaller arrows labeled "Spillover" pointing from each top oval to the bottom oval.
   - Two smaller arrows labeled "Catch-up" pointing from the bottom oval upwards, one toward the left oval and the other toward the right oval.

5. **Annotations:**
   - The term "Value Added" is positioned vertically along the left side of the image with an upward-pointing arrow.
   - The phrase "Industry creation" is written in light italic text above both top left and right ovals.

The layout visually suggests movement and interaction between "Emerging market economies" and the "Advanced economies" categories, focusing on concepts such as services, intangibles, spillover, and catch-up.
