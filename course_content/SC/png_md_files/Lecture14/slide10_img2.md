The image depicts a large round table surrounded by thirteen cartoon characters, each representing different personas. These characters are divided into two distinct groups: 

1. **Inside the Table**: 
   - There are seven characters sitting on tall chairs surrounding the top half of the table. Each individual is wearing formal attire, such as suits and ties, and expresses diverse facial expressions ranging from smiling to thoughtful or stern. 
   - These characters are illustrated with exaggerated features and are actively engaged in discussions. There are papers, pens, and a variety of charts spread across their section of the table.

2. **Outside the Table**: 
   - Six characters are seated on low stools around the bottom half of the table. They appear less formally dressed, wearing casual outfits. 
   - These individuals look up towards the table, displaying expressions suggestive of engagement, confusion, or contemplation.
   
The table itself is cluttered with an assortment of objects:
- Several books, papers, and writing utensils like pens and pencils are distributed randomly across the surface.
- There are lines and arrows connecting various points on the table, possibly indicating interactions or relationships between the items or individuals.

The surrounding characters are depicted in a dynamic manner, creating an impression of active involvement in a complex discussion or negotiation process. The overall theme appears to juxtapose the formal, possibly authoritative group with the less formal individuals, implying a hierarchical or consultative environment. The setting appears lively and animated, with all elements contributing to a sense of bustling activity and engagement in the central topic at hand.
