The image consists of four sequential illustrations of a ship-like structure interacting with a fluid, in stages from left to right. Each illustration depicts a different stage with labels and arrows. 

1. **First Illustration (Leftmost):**
   - The ship is positioned on the ocean, partly submerged.
   - Labeled "Lokasi bubuk" inside a central, rectangular panel on the ship.
   - Two large black arrows point upwards from below the ship.
   - Small black dots are scattered below the water, with a few rising upwards near the ship.

2. **Second Illustration (Second from Left):**
   - Similar ship structure with unchanged details from the first.
   - Labeled "Lokasi kuras" inside the rectangular panel.
   - Two black curved arrows originate from beneath the water level and curve upwards toward the sides of the ship.
   - Small black dots are directly beneath the ship.

3. **Third Illustration (Second from Right):**
   - Consistent ship structure and size.
   - The label inside the panel reads "Lokasi pembuangan."
   - The two black curved arrows from the second illustration are now larger, sweeping outward from the sides of the ship.
   - Black dots are more dispersed under the water.

4. **Fourth Illustration (Rightmost):**
   - The ship remains similar in structure and positioning.
   - The rectangular panel is labeled "Lokasi awal."
   - The large black arrows are now absent.
   - The black dots are scattered and spaced uniformly below the ocean surface.

The illustrations are set against a gradient background transitioning from a lighter tone at the top to a darker blue at the bottom, suggesting water. Each ship is identical in structure and positioned consistently across the illustrations. Each stage transitions smoothly, indicating a sequential or process-oriented framework.
