The image features a network diagram composed of nodes and arrows, structured as follows:

1. **Title and Labels**:
   - The top of the diagram contains the text "T Plant."
   - Below that, centered, is the label "End items."
   - Near the bottom, centered, is the label "Inputs."

2. **Nodes**:
   - The nodes are represented by pink circles.
   - There are three horizontal layers of nodes.

3. **Top Layer (End items)**:
   - Contains 9 nodes evenly spaced in a horizontal line.
   - Each node has a single arrow pointing upwards, away from it.

4. **Middle Layer**:
   - Contains 6 nodes arranged in a row.
   - Each node in the middle layer has arrows pointing to two nodes from the top layer. The connection is such that each middle node connects to adjacent top nodes.
   - Each middle node receives arrows from two nodes in the bottom layer, which form a V shape converging at the middle node.

5. **Bottom Layer (Inputs)**:
   - Contains 7 nodes arranged in a T-shaped pattern.
   - The node at the center of the T-shape has two arrows leading up to two nodes in the middle layer above it.
   - The four nodes forming the vertical part of the T have arrows pointing upwards to their adjacent middle layer nodes.
   - Each of the two horizontal nodes at the ends of the T's top has a single arrow pointing to its adjacent middle layer node.

6. **Arrows**:
   - All arrows are black and indicate direction between nodes.
   - Arrows generally move from the bottom layer upwards through the middle to the top layer.

The diagram visually represents a hierarchical and symmetrical structure with a focus on inputs leading to end items through a series of connected nodes.
