The image shows a large ship sailing on the ocean. The body of water is a deep blue, visible from above. The ship is oriented diagonally from the bottom center to the upper left of the frame. It is red in color with a white top deck. A prominent feature is the thick, white smoke billowing from the ship's funnel, extending upward and spreading out as it ascends, creating a large plume that occupies most of the upper part of the image. The smoke appears dense near the funnel and gradually becomes more diffuse toward the top. The ship is moving forward, generating a wake behind it that is slightly visible in the ocean. There are no other visible objects or structures on the water.
