The image features a matrix consisting of four quadrants within a larger rectangular area. The matrix is divided vertically and horizontally, creating four equal sections. 

**Top Row Descriptions:**
- **Left Quadrant:**
  - Background Color: Green
  - Text: "match" centered in black.

- **Right Quadrant:**
  - Background Color: Red
  - Text: "mismatch" centered in black.

**Bottom Row Descriptions:**
- **Left Quadrant:**
  - Background Color: Red
  - Text: "mismatch" centered in black.

- **Right Quadrant:**
  - Background Color: Green
  - Text: "match" centered in black.

**Horizontal Axis (Top):**
- On top of the matrix, the horizontal axis labels are centered above each column:
  - Left Label: "Functional Products"
  - Right Label: "Innovative Products"

**Vertical Axis (Left):**
- The vertical axis labels are positioned on the left side of the matrix, next to each row:
  - Top Label: "Efficient Supply Chain" with a light gray arrowhead pointing to the right.
  - Bottom Label: "Responsive Supply Chain" with a light gray arrowhead pointing to the left.

**Top Annotations:**
- Above the matrix, there are two sets of annotated descriptions linked to the horizontal axis labels:
  - Over "Functional Products": Description includes three bullet points:
    1. "Life cycle > 2 years"
    2. "Gross Margin < 35%"
    3. "Low Product Variety"
  - Over "Innovative Products": Description includes three bullet points:
    1. "Life cycle < 1 year"
    2. "Gross Margin > 35%"
    3. "High Product Variety"

**Left Annotations:**
- To the left of the matrix, there are two sets of annotations linked to the vertical axis labels:
  - Next to "Efficient Supply Chain": "Supply predictable demand efficiently at lowest cost"
  - Next to "Responsive Supply Chain": "Respond quickly to unpredictable demand to minimize stockouts, markdowns, and obsolete inventory"
