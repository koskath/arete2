The image is divided into two main sections labeled "4. Product system" and "5. System of systems." 

On the left side, under "4. Product system," there is a large grey rectangle containing:

1. An icon of a tractor with signal waves above it labeled "TRACTORS," positioned to the far left.
2. A large circle labeled "FARM EQUIPMENT SYSTEM" located in the center with four lines extending from it, each pointing to a specific label:
   - The top line pointing upwards is labeled "PLANTERS."
   - The right line pointing to the right is labeled "COMBINE HARVESTERS."
   - The bottom line pointing downwards is labeled "TILLERS."
3. An image of a tractor with signal waves pointing to the right, connecting to the right side labeled "FARM EQUIPMENT SYSTEM."

On the right side, under "5. System of systems," there is a connected diagram with five circles labeled as follows:

1. A circle at the top labeled "WEATHER DATA SYSTEM" with three lines extending from it:
   - The left line pointing to "RAIN, HUMIDITY, TEMPERATURE SENSORS."
   - The top line pointing to "WEATHER MAPS."
   - The right line pointing to "WEATHER FORECASTS."
   - The bottom right line pointing to "WEATHER DATA APPLICATION."

2. A circle on the left labeled "FARM EQUIPMENT SYSTEM."

3. A small circle at the center labeled "FARM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM," with lines connecting it to adjacent circles:
   - The top left line connects to "WEATHER DATA SYSTEM."
   - A line to the left connects to "FARM EQUIPMENT SYSTEM."
   - A line to the right connects to "SEED OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM."
   - A line below connects to "IRRIGATION SYSTEM."

4. A circle on the right labeled "SEED OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM" with three lines extending from it:
   - The right line pointing to "FARM PERFORMANCE DATABASE."
   - The top right line pointing to "SEED DATABASE."
   - The bottom right line pointing to "SEED OPTIMIZATION APPLICATION."

5. A circle at the bottom labeled "IRRIGATION SYSTEM" with three lines extending from it:
   - The left line pointing to "FIELD SENSORS."
   - The bottom line pointing to "IRRIGATION NODES."
   - The bottom right line pointing to "IRRIGATION APPLICATION."

The design uses curved connecting lines to indicate relationships between the systems within the "System of systems" section.
