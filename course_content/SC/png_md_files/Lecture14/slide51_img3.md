The image shows a large container ship titled "RENA" with "MONROVIA" written beneath it, tilting heavily to the right. The ship's hull is in the foreground, painted in black with white letters. Several stacks of cargo containers on the deck are visibly leaning and collapsing towards the starboard side of the ship due to the tilt. The containers are of various colors, including yellow, red, and blue, and are arranged in overlapping rows with some appearing damaged or dislodged.

Behind the tilted ship, on the right side of the image, there are parts of another vessel visible. This includes a blue crane-like structure and other maritime equipment, including an orange and rusty-looking platform on the far right. The water surrounding these vessels appears calm, reflecting parts of the ship and containers. The sky is overcast, adding to the subdued lighting of the scene.
