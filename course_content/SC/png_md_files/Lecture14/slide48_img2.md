Figure 2.2 is a pie chart illustrating the "Transport sector contribution to total GHG emissions, 2009 (EEA-32)."

The pie chart is circular and is divided into a large grey section and a smaller green section:

1. **Non-transport sectors (Grey Section):**
   - Occupies 76% of the pie.
   - Labeled as "Non-transport sectors 76%".
   - Represents the majority of the chart.

2. **Transport Section (Green Section):**
   - Occupies 24% of the pie.
   - Labeled as "Transport 24%".
   - Represents a smaller portion of the chart, highlighted in light green.

Adjacent to the pie chart, to the right, is a color-coded legend with percentages:

- **Green Segment:** "Road transport 17%"
- **Orange Segment:** "Other transport 1%"
- **Brown Segment:** "International maritime transport 3%"
- **Blue Segment:** "International aviation 3%"

Below the pie chart, there is a note stating:

"Note: Total GHG emissions are total emissions (sectors 1 to 7, excluding 5, LULUCF) plus bunkers. Other transport includes navigation, civil aviation (domestic aviation) and diesel rail. Electric rail, agricultural and fisheries related transport emissions are not included as transport."
