The image shows a large ship grounded on a muddy or rocky beach. The ship's hull is prominently visible, facing directly towards the viewer, with distinctive features. The lower part of the hull is painted blue and shows signs of rust, particularly towards the centerline and near the waterline. Above the blue section is a white area with rust stains dripping downwards.

The ship is flanked by two strong chains extending from the ship down to the ground, indicating an anchoring or mooring attempt. The chains lie on the muddy ground, with one chain visible on each side of the center. The ground is uneven and wet, displaying patches of standing water and muddy surfaces. The sky is overcast with grey clouds, contributing to a somber atmosphere.

The ship's superstructure includes several decks with a predominantly white surface and blue horizontal lines, indicating multiple levels. Antennas and communication equipment are located on top of the structure, adding to the ship's height. There is no visible crew or passengers on the ship, and no other vessels are in the immediate area. The background consists of a flat horizon with indistinct features, suggesting a vast, open setting.
