The image is a black and white photograph showing a coastal scene where several large ships are visible in the background. These ships are positioned on what appears to be a beach or mudflat. They are vast and decommissioned, suggesting a ship-breaking yard environment. 

In the foreground, a line of approximately ten individuals are standing in a staggered formation. They are spaced apart, and each is holding onto a long, thick rope. The individuals are facing away from the camera, and the perspective shows them slightly from the side. They are pulling the rope, which stretches into the distance toward the left side of the image. Each person is dressed in minimal clothing, and the terrain beneath them appears muddy and uneven, marked with ridges and tracks.

The rope held by the individuals leads toward the water or further down the beach, though the end point is not visible in the image. The landscape is barren and flat, with the horizon visible in the background where the sky meets the water. The overall tone of the image is gritty, with high contrast, emphasizing the texture of the land and the silhouettes of the ships and individuals.
