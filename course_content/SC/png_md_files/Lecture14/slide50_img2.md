The image consists of several elements arranged across the layout. 

In the top left corner, there is a large bold title: "LNG for Fuel."

Below the title is a bulleted text section with the heading: "LNG: reduce impact on environment," followed by three bullet points:
- "20% less CO2"
- "Up to 95% reductions of SOx and PM"
- "NOx reductions (15-90%)"

Further down, another heading reads: "Key challenges for shipping are:" followed by three more bullet points:
- "Substantial investments for Shipowners, Oil Majors and key suppliers"
- "Issues related to Bunkering (terminals, bunker boats, procedures, etc.)"
- "Uncertainty regarding the future LNG bunker price"

To the right of the text, there is a diagram of a ship. It appears as a technical schematic, showing a side view with multiple compartments. One section is highlighted in orange with a red outline.

Below the ship diagram, in the bottom right quadrant, is a line graph labeled on the y-axis as "2008 dollars per million Btu." The x-axis spans from 1990 to 2035, marked in increments: 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035. The y-axis has labeled increments of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25.

Two curved lines are drawn within the graph:
- A gray line labeled "Crude oil" in the upper section
- A green line labeled "Natural gas" in the lower section

Both lines show fluctuations over the years, with a prominent peak around the year 2008 and diverging trends moving forward.

Below the graph is the text: "Ref. U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)"

At the very bottom right corner, there is a logo, featuring a star-like symbol followed by the word "MAERSK."
