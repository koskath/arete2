ABC and XYZ Analysis Description:

1. **Top Left Section - ABC-Analysis - purchasing volume:**
   - **Background:** Light blue.
   - **Text:**
     - Title: "ABC-Analysis - purchasing volume:"
     - Description: "Standard method for categorizing objects into three categories. The ranking depends on the importance of the analyzed objects."

2. **Bottom Left Section - Graph of ABC-Analysis:**
   - **Layout:** Rectangular grid background in light blue.
   - **Axes:**
     - Y-axis labeled as "value [%]" ranging from 0 to 100.
     - X-axis labeled as "quantity [%]" ranging from 0 to 100.
   - **Data Representation:**
     - Three colored sections labeled A, B, and C.
     - **Region A:** Small triangular area, base on x-axis from 0 to approximately 20, height near 80 on y-axis.
     - **Region B:** Quadrilateral, base on x-axis from approximately 20 to 50, top starts slightly below 80 on y-axis and ends slightly above 80.
     - **Region C:** Large trapezoidal area, base on x-axis from 50 to 100, top starts slightly above 80 on y-axis and ends slightly below 100.
   - **Lines and Points:**
     - Lines connect starting and ending points with red squares at data points.

3. **Right Section - XYZ-Analysis - Demand Continuity:**
   - **Background:** Light blue.
   - **Text:**
     - Title: "XYZ-Analysis - Demand Continuity:"
     - Description: "Method for classification of materials according to their pattern of consumption. The categorization into three groups depends on the forecast accuracy of consumption and thus on the factor to what extent reliable planning is possible."
     - Subsection "Grouping in Three Classes:": Bold text
     - X-Class: "Materials with regular consumption resp. constant demand, high forecast accuracy."
     - Y-Class: "Materials with trend-like consumption (in-/decreasing, seasonal fluctuations), medium forecast accuracy."
     - Z-Class: "Materials with very irregular consumption, very low forecast accuracy."
