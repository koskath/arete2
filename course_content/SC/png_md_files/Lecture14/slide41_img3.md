The image features a horizontal diagram labeled "VALUE CHAIN DISAGGREGATION" at the bottom. At the top of the image, there is a thick horizontal arrow pointing from left to right, labeled "Input" on the left side and "Market" on the right side. Above this arrow, there is an incomplete word that reads as "knowledge."

Below the arrow, there are five vertical grey arrows evenly spaced along the horizontal arrow. Each gray arrow points upwards towards the thick horizontal arrow. Beneath each grey arrow, there is a label for a "Location" as follows:

1. The first vertical grey arrow points up to a section labeled "Location 1."
2. The second vertical grey arrow points up to a section labeled "Location 2."
3. The third vertical grey arrow points up to a section labeled "Location 3."
4. The fourth vertical grey arrow points up to a section labeled "Location 4."
5. The fifth vertical grey arrow points up to a section labeled "Location 5."

The first and fifth locations share the same label, "Location 1." The layout implies a progression from input to market across multiple locations, with implied repetition at "Location 1." The elements and text are aligned horizontally along the path of the main arrow.
