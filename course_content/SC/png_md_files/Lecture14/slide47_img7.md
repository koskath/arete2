The image exhibits a vertical, segmented funnel diagram on a gray background with three distinct globe representations stacked vertically within the funnel. The left side of the image features four labels in black text:

1. "1500 - 1840"
2. "1850 - 1930"
3. "1950s"
4. "1960s"

The funnel is divided into sections, each containing a globe and associated annotations in black text:

1. The top section shows a large globe depicting simplified landmasses on the earth's surface. Below the globe, the text reads, "Durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit von Pferdekarren und Segelschiffen 10 mph."

2. The middle section contains a smaller globe, also showing landmasses, with text underneath stating, "Dampfmaschinen erreichen eine Durchschnittsgeschw. von 65 mph, Dampfschiffe von 36 mph."

3. The bottom section presents the smallest globe, with text beneath it, "Propellerflugzeuge fliegen mit 400 mph."

Below the funnel diagram, additional text reads, "Flugzeuge fliegen mit mehr als 700 mph," without any corresponding globe image.

The diagram visually represents the progression of transportation speeds and technologies over time. Each segment of the funnel decreases in size moving downward, correlating to advancements in speed capabilities. The text within the image is written in German and provides specific speed measurements in miles per hour (mph) for different modes of transportation during their respective eras.
