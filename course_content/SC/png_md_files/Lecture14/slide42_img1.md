The image is a diagram labeled "VALUE CHAIN DISAGGREGATION" at the bottom. It features a large horizontal arrow stretching from left to right. The arrow is thick and black, with a slightly pointed head on the right side, symbolizing direction from "Inputs" to "Markets." The word "Inputs" appears on the left, with a lighter font, and the word "Markets" on the right, also in a lighter font. 

Above and along the length of the horizontal arrow, there are four lighter, upward-pointing arrows labeled "Location 1," "Location 2," "Location 3," and "Location 4," evenly spaced across the arrow from left to right. 

Above the horizontal arrow and the location labels, there's a broad arc or curve that stretches across nearly the entire width of the diagram. Inside this arc, from left to right, are the words "R&D Knowledge" on the left and "Marketing Knowledge" on the right, both in a bold and italicized font. 

Within the curve, closer to the center, there is a smaller circle with a light gray outline containing two bullet points: 
- "Tangibles"
- "Manufacturing"

These elements are centrally placed within the curved area, indicating a focus on "Tangibles" and "Manufacturing" as key aspects of the value chain. 

Overall, the diagram visually represents a flow from inputs to markets, highlighting the spatial distribution of different processes across multiple locations within a value chain.
