The image depicts a structured diagram with multiple sections and text. At the top, there is a white rectangle containing the text:

"Best Quality - Lowest Cost - Shortest Lead Time - Best Safety - High Morale through shortening the production flow by eliminating waste"

Below this, the diagram is divided into three vertical sections, each with a different background color: 

1. The left section is labeled "Just-in-Time" and lists:
   - Right part, right amount, right time
   - Takt time planning

The diagram presents a hierarchical structure, emphasizing the foundational elements at the bottom and strategic goals at the top.
