The image depicts a large naval aircraft carrier docked on the water. The view is from the front-left side, showing the ship's bow prominently. The hull of the carrier is painted mostly gray, with some dark patches visible on its side. Several ropes and cables are hanging over the side of the ship. The flight deck extends outward over the hull, curving slightly upward at the front.

Above the flight deck, there is a narrow, multi-level superstructure containing communication and radar equipment, with several antennae and a signal mast protruding upwards. The sky is clear above, and the sea is calm, reflecting the ship's hull.

On the bottom left of the image, along the dock, there are some small structures, possibly part of the pier infrastructure. The background shows a distant shore on the right side of the image.

At the bottom of the image, there is a caption with the text "The 32,000 ton Clemenceau has served France well," and the letters "AP" appear in the bottom right corner, likely indicating the Associated Press as the source.
