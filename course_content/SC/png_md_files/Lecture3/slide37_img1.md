The image displays a structured diagram consisting of a table and an arrow representing relational dynamics in supply chains. 

The table is divided into two main columns:

1. **Arm’s-length relationships**:
   - Comprises two subdivisions:
     - **Vendors**
     - **Traditional suppliers**

2. **Collaborative relationships**:
   - Comprises three subdivisions:
     - **Certified suppliers**
     - **Partnership-type relationship**
     - **Strategic alliances**

Below the table, an arrow spans horizontally from left to right. The arrow is labeled with a gradient fill from light gray on the left to dark gray on the right, indicating the progression of value and importance.

- The left side of the arrow is labeled as "Low," with the annotation "Lower value-added relationships."
- The right side of the arrow is labeled as "High," with the annotation "Higher value-added relationships."
- The text "Strategic importance of the purchase" is centered on the arrow.
