The image features a segment of a diagram with curved lines and textual annotations describing components of a supply chain. At the top center, there is a curved line with the following text along it:

- "Parts – touchscreen" with "Balda (Germany)" beneath it.
- "Parts - chips" with "Samsung (Korea)" beneath it and "NXP Semiconductor (The Netherlands)" below that.
- "Assembly" with "Inventec (Taiwan)" directly underneath and "Hon Hai Precision Industry (Taiwan)" below that.
- "Advertising" situated above the curved line with "TBWA/Chiat/Day (US)" following.

To the left, outside the curved line, the text "R&D Knowledge" is written in bold and italicized font.

On the opposite side, also outside and in bold italicized font, is "Marketing Knowledge."

The positions of the annotations are aligned to suggest a hierarchy or flow from top to bottom within the sectioned area of the curve. The text styles include underlining and italicization to emphasize certain words. The overall layout indicates a segmentation of roles or sources within a larger system.
