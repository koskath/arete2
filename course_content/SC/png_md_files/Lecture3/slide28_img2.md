The image is a line graph titled "The Extent of Artificial Demand Distortion." It illustrates the variation in grocery store soft-drink sales over 32 weeks in 1999. The graph is divided into weeks 1 to 32 on the horizontal axis and "Thousands of Cases" on the vertical axis, ranging from 0 to 200.

Three lines represent different data sets:
1. A thin black line representing "Customer Sales (Electronic Point of Sales)," which fluctuates between roughly 20,000 and 60,000 cases.
2. A light gray line with a sharper pattern labeled "Orders that stores place at the regional distribution center (RDC)," showing higher volatility with peaks at weeks 6, 15, and 26, reaching up to around 190,000 cases.
3. A medium gray line indicating "Orders the RDC places at the supplier to replenish product," also with sharp fluctuations, peaking at weeks 9, 19, and 32, reaching similar peaks of about 150,000 cases.

The annotated text before the graph reads: "Over 32 weeks, grocery stores in a study recorded weekly soft-drink sales of 18,000 to 60,000 cases, but by the time the supplier got the order, the range had been distorted to 0 to 205,000 cases."
