The image features a circular diagram with various elements arranged in a symmetric layout. At the center are three stylized, cartoon-like figures representing people; one with long hair and the other two with short hair, wearing business attire.

Surrounding the central figures are five circular icons evenly spaced around the circle:

1. **Top**: An icon depicting a storefront with an awning in the circle.
2. **Bottom**: An icon of an envelope, suggesting communication or mail.
3. **Bottom-left**: An icon of a desktop computer with a monitor and keyboard.
4. **Top-left**: An icon of a smartphone with a blank screen.
5. **Top-right**: An icon with a stylized bird silhouette, resembling a logo representing social media or communication.

These icons are positioned along the perimeter of the circle and connected to each other by dual concentric circular lines forming a ring around the central figures. The entire image uses a monochromatic color scheme, primarily in shades of purple.
