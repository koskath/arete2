The image consists of three sections, each depicting a human figure with corresponding arrows and icons beneath them.

1. **Top Section (Human Figures):**
   - **Left Figure:** A stylized representation of a person with short hair, wearing a short-sleeved shirt with a collar. The figure is depicted in a purple hue and faces forward.
   - **Middle Figure:** A stylized person with medium-length hair, wearing a collared shirt that is slightly open at the neck, in a similar purple hue.
   - **Right Figure:** A stylized person with short hair, depicted wearing a collared shirt and a tie, facing forward in the same purple tone.

2. **Middle Section (Arrows):**
   - Each figure has a pair of vertical arrows below them:
     - **Left Pair of Arrows:** Directly beneath the left figure, starting from the figure's feet and extending downward, with one arrow pointing upward and the other downward. The upward arrow is lighter in shade than the downward arrow.
     - **Middle Pair of Arrows:** Similar arrangement under the middle figure, with one arrow pointing up and the other down. The upward arrow is lighter than the downward arrow.
     - **Right Pair of Arrows:** Positioned beneath the right figure, containing an upward and a downward arrow, with the upward arrow lighter than the downward arrow.

3. **Bottom Section (Icons):**
   - Three circular icons are aligned horizontally, each corresponding to one of the figures above:
     - **Left Icon:** A circle containing a simplified representation of a storefront with an awning, inside a light purple circle.
     - **Middle Icon:** A circle containing a representation of a computer monitor, indicative of technology or desktop use.
     - **Right Icon:** A circle containing a simplified representation of a smartphone.

Each figure is vertically aligned with their pair of arrows and associated icon, and the elements are set against a white background with a minimalist, monochromatic purple color scheme. Dashed vertical lines separate the three sections, enhancing the distinction between them.
