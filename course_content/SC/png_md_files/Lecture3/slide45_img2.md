The image features a simplistic, stylized representation divided into three main elements, oriented vertically on a light gray background.

1. **Top Element: Person Icon**
   - Positioned at the top of the image.
   - Depicts a person from the waist up.
   - The figure is shaded in a purple hue, with short hair, and is wearing a short-sleeved collared shirt. The facial features are not detailed.
   - The arms are slightly bent at the elbow.

2. **Middle Element: Arrows**
   - Two thick, parallel arrows extend vertically between the person icon and the bottom symbol.
   - The left arrow points downward, while the right arrow points upward.
   - Both arrows are shaded in purple with a gradient effect, darker at the base and lighter towards the tip.
   - The downward arrow head is broad and triangular; the upward arrow head is similar but inverted.

3. **Bottom Element: Store Icon**
   - Located at the bottom of the image.
   - Circular in shape with a stylized representation of a storefront inside.
   - The storefront features a gable roof, central doorway, and two horizontal lines suggesting windows or panels.
   - The icon is filled with a solid purple shade matching the other elements.
  
The three elements are aligned centrally and symmetrically along a vertical axis from top to bottom.
