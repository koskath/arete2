The image presents a schematic representation of value chain disaggregation. At the top center, there is a curved horizontal line which forms a concave shape. Below this line, in the left section, the text "R&D Knowledge" is written in bold and italic. In the right section, "Marketing Knowledge" is similarly styled. Near the top, inside a smaller oval within the curved area, are two bullet points listing "Tangibles" and "Manufacturing."

Below the curved line, a thick horizontal arrow spans from left to right, labeled "Inputs" at the left end and "Markets" at the right end. Along this arrow, four upward-pointing arrows are distributed evenly, each associated with a location label:

1. Directly beneath the first gray arrow is "Location 1."
2. The second gray arrow marks "Location 2."
3. The third gray arrow indicates "Location 3."
4. The fourth gray arrow points to "Location 4."

At the very bottom of the image, centered below the arrow, the phrase "VALUE CHAIN DISAGGREGATION" is written in capital letters. The entire layout is symmetrical and focuses on distinguishing between stages in a value chain process across different geographical locations.
