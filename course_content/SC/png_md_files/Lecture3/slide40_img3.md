The image features several elements arranged primarily in a vertical layout:

1. Top Left: The words "Value Added" are oriented vertically, with "Value" above "Added."

2. Center Left:
   - Underlined text: "APPLE (US)"
   - Below it, the text reads: "Basic and applied R&D, Product Design, Commercialization"
   
3. Below "APPLE (US)" text:
   - Underlined text: "Chip Design"
   - Following it, the text reads: "ARM Holdings (The UK)"

4. Right-hand side:
   - Underlined text: "APPLE (US)"
   - Below it, the text reads: "Marketing, Brand management, After-sales services"

5. Arrows:
   - A black curved arrow points upwards from just above the first underlined "APPLE (US)" towards the text "Value Added."
   - The tip of the arrow is filled and is positioned directly left of "Value Added."

These elements are arranged spatially to suggest a flow or hierarchical relationship, with the arrows indicating a movement or process linked to the "Value Added" concept.
