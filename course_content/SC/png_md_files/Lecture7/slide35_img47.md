The image shows two vertically oriented, elongated shapes that occupy the majority of the frame against a white background. 

On the left side, there is a shape in the form of a smooth, tapered cylinder that is colored light brown. Its top edge is not visible in the frame, but it tapers downwards, becoming slightly narrower towards the base.

On the right side of the image, there is another smooth, tapered cylindrical shape. This one is colored light blue and follows a similar tapering pattern as the brown shape, becoming slightly narrower towards the bottom.

Both shapes are positioned parallel to each other, with a small gap of white space between them. The top and bottom edges of these shapes are cut off by the boundaries of the image. The leftmost and rightmost edges of the image show a small amount of a dark gray border.
