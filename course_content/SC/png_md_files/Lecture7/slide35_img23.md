The image consists of a very narrow rectangular slice with several distinct color sections. On the left side, there is a vertical dark gray stripe occupying about one-third of the width. Adjacent to this stripe is a white area which forms an irregular polygon with a slanted right edge. To the right of the white section, the image has a large black trapezoid that covers the remaining area. The black trapezoid has a sloped left edge touching the white section and a straight right border aligned vertically. The trapezoid's top and bottom edges appear to run horizontally across the image. The black section also shows faint horizontal lines, indicating a gradient or texture.
