The image consists of several distinct areas and lines:

1. **Vertical Section**: 
   - To the left, there is a solid black vertical rectangle.
   - Adjacent to the right of this rectangle is a white vertical strip, slightly narrower than the black strip.
   - Immediately next to the white strip is a thinner blue vertical line.

2. **Diagonal Element**:
   - Crossing from the mid-right to the bottom left section of the image is a thick diagonal black area. It forms a triangular shape that narrows as it moves from top right to bottom left.

3. **White Background**:
   - The remainder of the image constitutes a white background, which makes up the central section and extends to the areas not covered by the other elements.

4. **Visible Blue Structure**:
   - On the white background towards the right, partly overlapping the diagonal black section, is a fragment of what appears to be blue lettering or a logo. The visible part consists of a curved line with a sharp point angled towards the bottom left, partially obscured by the overall layout.

The elements are in simple monochrome and two-color tones, emphasizing the visual structures and their alignment within the image. No additional annotations or data points are present.
