The image consists of two overlapping rectangular flags. The flag in the background is red with a large yellow star near the top left corner and four smaller yellow stars arranged in an arc to the right of the large star. The flag in the foreground has a blue background with a circle of twelve equally spaced yellow stars. The blue flag partially obscures the red flag, mostly covering its lower half and slightly overlapping on the left side. The flags are positioned with the red on the top left and the blue on the bottom right.
