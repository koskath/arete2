A section of an image is presented, containing four distinct color areas. On the left, there is a narrow vertical beige strip bordering a larger, mostly white area. At the top-center, the word "KOSEN" is written in uppercase, blue, italicized font, slanted upwards to the right. This lettering partially overlaps a larger, trapezoidal blue-grey field that dominates the right side of the image. The sequence of these elements creates an abstract composition with sharp, clean edges and angular relationships.
