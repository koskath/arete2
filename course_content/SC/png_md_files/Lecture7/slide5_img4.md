The image displays a section of a colored world map on a cylindrical surface. The map features various countries in different colors, including orange, blue, light blue, green, and white, to distinguish between them. There are visible border lines separating each country. The map appears to be segmented into a vertical, triangular strip with a teal oceanic background surrounding the landmasses. White lines indicate longitudinal and latitudinal markings across the map, intersecting at various points. The map section is positioned slightly off-center to the left, leaving a wide white vertical band on the right side of the image, providing contrast to the detailed map on the left.
