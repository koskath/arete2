The image shows two geometric shapes against a gray background. On the left side, there is a beige triangular shape with a dark shadow along its right edge, angled inward towards a white area. Adjacent to this, on the right, there is a larger teal trapezoidal shape. The left edge of the teal shape slightly overlaps with the white area. The image is bordered by a vertical gray strip on the far right. The overall composition is simple, with large blocks of color and no text or smaller details visible.
