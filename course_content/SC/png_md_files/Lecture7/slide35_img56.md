The image consists of a composition of geometric shapes and colors. On the left side, there is a large, slanted, dark gray rectangle that extends diagonally from the top left corner and tapers towards the center of the image. Adjacent to it, towards the right, is a slim, vertical, white triangle shape extending downward with its base at the top of the image.

Further to the right, there is a small blue rectangle tilted at an angle, positioned just below the middle horizontal axis of the image. This blue rectangle's right edge aligns closely with the edge of the gray section, creating a junction between the two areas.

On the extreme right side, there is a prominent black trapezoidal shape. This shape starts wide at the top right corner and narrows downwards as it progresses to the center, with the bottom edge tapering towards a slender triangular point.

The background surrounding these shapes is predominantly white, creating contrast that accentuates the geometric forms. The entire arrangement gives the appearance of abstract, intersecting planes with varying shades and a clear distinction between each colored area.
