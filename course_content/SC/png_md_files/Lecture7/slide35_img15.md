The image is divided into three vertical sections with varying colors and contents:

1. The left section features a partial view of a structure with a pattern of vertical and diagonal lines. The colors are shades of blue and grey, creating an appearance similar to glass or a reflective surface. The pattern suggests depth and perspective, possibly indicating a building or stylized architectural element.

2. The middle section is light green and has parts of letters and shapes visible. The section includes a dark silhouette that could resemble a person or a figure. There are faint lines and subtle elements suggesting text or a textured background.

3. The right section is primarily dark, with the visible part of a white word "ENG" on it. The letters are cut off at the start, suggesting it is part of a larger word or phrase. The background of this section appears to be a dark, possibly black or dark grey, creating a strong contrast with the light letters.

The sections are aligned next to each other with no visible separation lines, blending slightly at their borders. The overall composition is abstract and modern.
