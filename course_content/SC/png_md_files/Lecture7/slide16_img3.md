The image features two distinct sections. On the left side, there are three small black dots aligned horizontally. On the right side, there is an illustration of a yellow scroll with blue edges that appears to be partially unrolled. The top and bottom edges of the scroll have spiral designs at the left ends. 

Inside the scroll, there is black text divided into two sections. The first section reads: 
"Union Customs Code (UCC) 
Reg. (EU) No. 952/2013"

The second section reads:
"Union Customs Code Implementing Acts (IA) & Delegated Acts (DA)"

The scroll is oriented vertically, and the text is aligned to the left margin within the scroll. The background is plain white, and there are no other elements present in the image.
