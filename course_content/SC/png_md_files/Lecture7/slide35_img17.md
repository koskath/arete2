The image consists of two main vertical sections separated by a narrow white gap. 

On the left side, there is a predominantly dark gray and bluish area that appears abstract and blurry. It contains waving light and dark shades, with no distinct shapes or elements identifiable. The colors transition from darker shades at the top to slightly lighter tones towards the bottom. 

On the right side, there is a blend of greenish and yellow tones. This section also appears abstract and has a blurred texture. The colors here transition from lighter at the top to slightly darker towards the bottom. There is a subtle hint of horizontal lines, which might suggest a texture or pattern, but no clear forms or annotations are discernible.

The background of the entire image is bordered by additional darker gray bars on both the extreme left and right edges. These bars frame the main vertical sections of the image.
