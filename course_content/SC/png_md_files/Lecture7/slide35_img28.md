The image contains a portion of a design with several overlapping elements. On the left side, there is a large, rectangular, beige-colored shape, positioned horizontally. To the right of the beige rectangle, a section of blue text is visible, with the words slanting upwards from left to right; the text reads "NATIONAL...". Above the text, there’s a fragmented view of what appears to be a triangular shape with a green interior, outlined by a darker border. The top right corner shows a black shape, which appears roughly rectangular with its longer side aligned vertically. The background is predominantly white. Not all elements are fully visible, and these shapes appear to be part of a cropped or partially observed graphic.
