The image contains only partial, fragmented elements. There is a visible area with a blue text, which is not completely shown but includes the letters "EDELSKLAUSFELN." This text is slanted, aligning diagonally from the lower left to the upper right on a white background. To the right, there is a flat, angled surface in a light blue color. On the far left, a very small portion of a dark shape is barely visible against a slightly beige backdrop. The top and bottom portions of the image are cut off, leaving only these visual fragments visible.
