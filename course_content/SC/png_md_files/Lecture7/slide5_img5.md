The image is divided into two main panels, with each panel depicting a stylized map. The background is predominantly teal with white spaces dividing the image. On the left side, there is a portion of the map showing parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Countries are colored in various shades, notably orange, light green, and white. There is a label reading "EU" placed within the European region, surrounded by countries shaded in green.

The right side of the image shows a portion of South America. Here, the map highlights a section in orange with an annotation "MERCOSUR" prominently located in the northern part of the continent. Surrounding regions are partially visible with borders indicated in white. Both maps are connected by several white, diagonal lines suggesting connections or interactions between these geographical areas.
