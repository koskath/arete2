The image is divided into three distinct sections, each with different colors and shapes. 

1. The left section is a vertical dark gray rectangle, taking up a small portion of the leftmost side of the image.
2. The middle section is a white trapezoidal shape. It starts from the top of the dark gray rectangle and expands diagonally upwards toward the top right corner. The shape tapers as it goes from left to right.
3. The right section is a black triangular shape. It is positioned next to the white trapezoid and expands diagonally downwards from the top to the bottom. This section includes horizontal bands that appear as slightly lighter stripes, suggesting a gradient or shading effect. 

The spatial relationship shows a clear separation and transition between the gray, white, and black sections, forming a composition of contrasting colors and diagonal lines.
