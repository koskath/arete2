The image displays a flowchart with a series of boxes, arrows, and icons, organized in two horizontal rows within a rounded rectangle. 

**Top Row**:
1. On the left, there is a blue rectangle with the EU flag (a circle of yellow stars on a blue field). An arrow points right from this rectangle, indicating movement or progression.
2. The next box contains the text "Outward Processing" alongside an icon of a person at a customs desk, highlighted by the background split into a white and light blue area.
3. Another arrow points right to a blue rectangle with the EU flag, labeled "Temporary Exportation."
4. An arrow from this rectangle continues right, leading to a two-line label with the words, "Processing in a third, non-EU country."
5. Adjacent to this label is an icon of two interlocking gears.

**Bottom Row**:
1. On the left, a rectangular flag display with a Chinese flag (red background with small yellow stars) partially covering an EU flag. An arrow points leftwards away from the flag.
2. Moving left, a box contains the text "Release into free Circulation," accompanied by a customs icon with two overlapping euro symbols (€) pointing upwards in the icon.
3. From this box, an arrow points right back towards the flag arrangement of the Chinese flag partially covering the EU flag, labeled "Re-Importation."

The flowchart uses directional arrows to guide the viewer through the process of goods moving from the EU, undergoing processing in a non-EU country, and then re-entering the EU-China arrangement. The layout implies a cyclical process, signifying outward processing and subsequent re-importation.
