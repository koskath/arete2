The image is a map section displaying parts of various landmasses with different colors indicating different regions or countries. The background is predominantly a blue-green ocean with several curved white lines, suggesting latitudinal and longitudinal lines on a globe representation.

- To the left side, a section of orange-colored land has a white border running along its right edge.
- In the center, there is a large expanse of light yellow-colored landmass with a relatively smooth border along its right edge. This landmass is bordered on three sides by different colors.
- Toward the right side, an orange-colored landmass is prominent with a distinct coast. Upon this landmass, the text "NAFTA" is prominently labeled in bold, black, uppercase letters.
- On the far right, a small segment of land is outlined in orange with some internal detailing visible, adjacent to a small area colored in a lighter shade of green, suggesting a transition between regions.
- In the background, a series of crisscrossing white lines originate from a central point on the orange region on the right, extending outward across the map, resembling radiating connections or routes.

The map's style suggests the focus on illustrating regional groupings or trade agreements, as indicated by the labeled text.
