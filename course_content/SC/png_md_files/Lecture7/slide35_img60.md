A horizontal black line extends across the entire image from left to right. The line is thick, with a subtle gradient, slightly lighter at the top and bottom edges, giving it a three-dimensional appearance. The line is set against a white background. On the right side, the line's thickness tapers down sharply into a pointed arrowhead. There are no annotations, labels, or additional markings on the image. The arrowhead is aligned with the center axis of the line, providing a symmetrical appearance.
