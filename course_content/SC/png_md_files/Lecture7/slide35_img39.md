A partial image showing two main colors and textures. On the left side, there is a section with a wood-like texture featuring curved and straight edges. A large black circular element is partially visible within the wooden area. On the right side, there is a light blue surface with a smooth texture, where a small dark gray protrusion is situated near the boundary of the blue and white areas. The background is predominantly white with a slight gray border at the bottom and top of the image, creating a frame around the central elements. The image is partially cut off, showing only fragments of the objects.
