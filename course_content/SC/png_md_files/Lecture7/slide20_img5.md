The image contains two overlapping flags. 

The top flag is the flag of China. It has a red background with five yellow stars in the top left corner. One large star is on the left, with four smaller stars forming a semicircle to its right.

The bottom flag, partially obscured by the top flag, is the flag of the European Union. It features a blue background with a circle of twelve yellow five-pointed stars in the center.

The Chinese flag is positioned slightly to the left and on top of the European Union flag, blocking part of the latter from view. The flags are arranged at an angle, giving the impression that the Chinese flag is slightly leaning to the right.
