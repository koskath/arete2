The image consists of a stylized map-like graphic. The background is mostly solid teal with several white shapes representing landmasses. There are thin white lines crisscrossing the teal background that seem to represent global latitude and longitude lines or boundaries. On the right side, a white rectangular label with a thin black border appears. Inside this rectangle, there is black text reading "Economic & Monetary Union." To the left of this text, a small square filled with a bright green color is present, partially overlapping the edge of the rectangle. The overall design is abstract and minimalist, with emphasis on the color contrast between the teal, white, and green elements. The bottom and right edges are trimmed in black.
