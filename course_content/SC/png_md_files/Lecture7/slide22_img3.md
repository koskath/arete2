The image is a flowchart depicting a process flow with several elements:

1. **Background and Borders:**
   - The flowchart is enclosed within a rounded rectangle with a thin border.

2. **Left Element:**
   - To the left, there are two vertical, rectangular bars. The top bar is light blue, and the bottom bar is yellow. These are partially cut off and positioned to the left of a blue rightward-pointing arrow.

3. **First Box on Top Row:**
   - To the right of the blue arrow is a rectangular box with rounded corners.
   - Inside the box, the text reads "Processing under Customs Control." "Customs" is written as "Cust- oms," indicating a hyphenated line break.
   - Overlapping this text is a red symbol: a circle with a diagonal line through it (similar to a "No" or "Prohibition" symbol) overlaying a Euro symbol (€) depicted in black.

4. **Top Row Flow:**
   - An arrow extends from this first box to a second box on the right.
   - The second box also has rounded corners.
   - It contains the text "Processing in the EU."
   - Adjacent to this text on the right is a black cogwheel with a Euro symbol (€) positioned in its center.

5. **Middle Row Flow:**
   - A downward-pointing arrow leads from the "Processing in the EU" box to another arrow that points to a third box on the bottom right.
   - The bottom box has rounded corners and contains the text "Release into free Circulation."
   - Beside this text is a black Euro symbol (€).

6. **Middle Left Element:**
   - In the middle left section of the flowchart, approximately aligned between the first and third boxes, is an image of an EU flag. It features yellow stars forming a circle on a blue background.
   - A blue rightward-pointing arrow initiates from the EU flag and points to the "Release into free Circulation" box.

This flowchart illustrates a process involving "Processing under Customs Control," moving into "Processing in the EU," and ultimately leading to "Release into free Circulation," with a visual emphasis on the European Union.
