The image is a partial view that includes several diagonal visual elements. On the left side, there is a vertical dark gray stripe, followed by a beige section with a smooth texture. Adjacent to this, a segment of text is visible, showing blue letters that are rotated diagonally. The discernible words are “INTERNATIONALER UND INTER.” To the right is a muted background with blurred sections in shades of grey and green, suggesting out-of-focus objects or surfaces. Another dark vertical line appears on the extreme right last section. The overall arrangement is abstract, focusing on text and abstract shapes with no clear central focus.
