The image is divided into two main sections: a map on the left and a legend on the right. 

On the left side, the map is primarily colored in teal with visible geographic and maritime boundaries marked in white. There is an orange region within the teal area, and several white grid lines curve across the map, indicating lines of latitude and longitude. Part of a continent with a jagged coastline is visible in white and teal, featuring an orange-shaded region on its northeastern part. Several smaller white areas are scattered within the teal background, indicating islands or territories.

On the right side, the legend is composed of three color-coded symbols followed by descriptions, all aligned vertically. The first color block is orange, labeled as "Customs Union." The second color block is light blue, labeled as "Customs & Monetary Union." The third color block is light green, labeled as "Economic Union." Each description is written in black text aligned horizontally with their respective color block on the left.

Overall, the image combines geographic and color-coded symbolic elements to present information related to different types of unions.
