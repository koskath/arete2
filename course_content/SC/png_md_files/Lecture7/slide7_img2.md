The image is a Venn diagram illustrating the overlap of various international organizations, each represented by a colored rectangle with a label and corresponding national flags inside. The background is a pale yellow.

- **SAARC**: Located in the top left corner, inside a pink rectangle. It contains flags arranged in two columns. The left column has four flags, each with distinct designs and colors. The right column has four flags, similar in arrangement, with a total of eight flags.

- **ECO**: Encased in a green rectangle overlapping SAARC and extending down leftwards. It contains flags in two columns. The left column has five flags, differing from each other. The right column also has five flags, each unique.

- **BIMSTEC**: Enclosed in a blue rectangle that overlaps with the top right corner of both SAARC and ECO. It contains two columns of flags. The left column contains four flags, and the right column has three flags.

- **MGC**: Represented by an orange rectangle that overlaps the boundary between SAARC and BIMSTEC in the center top. It contains two national flags side by side, each distinct in appearance.

- **ASEAN**: Inside a red rectangle overlapping BIMSTEC. It is arranged with two rows and five flags. Each flag is distinct in design, with different colors and symbols.

- **SCO**: A light blue rectangle at the center-bottom. It overlaps ECO and extends into ACD. It contains two rows and four flags arranged distinctly in separate columns.

- **ACD**: A beige background encompassing the entire diagram. No individual rectangle but contains arrangements and overlapping sections without specific boundaries.

- **GCC**: Located in the bottom right corner within a yellow rectangle that overlaps ACD. It contains two vertical columns with three flags in each, all different from each other.

Each organization’s rectangle overlaps with certain others, indicating common member countries by shared flags. The flags vary in color, design, patterns, and symbols, collectively showing the complex relationships among these international groups.
