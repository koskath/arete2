The image depicts a horizontal flowchart with five main elements, showing a process involving flags and arrows. 

1. On the far left, a red flag with yellow stars, representing China, is shown.

2. An arrow extends rightward from the Chinese flag to a rectangular box labeled "Inward Processing." Inside this box, there is a red cancel symbol (a circle with a diagonal line through it) overlaying a black symbol of three stacked coins.

3. Another rightward-pointing arrow leads from the "Inward Processing" box to a rectangular box labeled "Processing in the EU." This box contains two black gear symbols.

4. From the "Processing in the EU" box, a rightward arrow points to a rectangular box labeled "Re-Exportation," which contains two overlapping flags: the Chinese flag and a blue flag with yellow stars, representing the EU.

5. Below the "Processing in the EU" box, a downward arrow leads to another rectangular box labeled "Release into free Circulation." Inside this box, there are three black coin symbols, each labeled with a currency sign: "£," "€," and a second "€," representing currency symbols for British Pounds and Euros.

6. A leftward-pointing arrow extends from below the "Release into free Circulation" box, leading back to the overlapping EU and Chinese flags.

All elements are enclosed within a larger rectangular border, except for the initial Chinese flag on the left.
