The image contains two adjacent panels. 

The left panel is primarily a skewed vertical section of a brown surface, occupying most of its space. At the upper part of this panel, there is a small segment of a black object partially visible against the brown background. 

The right panel features a predominantly blue surface. This area is also skewed and occupies the majority of the right panel's space. Near the upper side, there are indistinct dark shapes against the blue background, casting a shadow-like effect.

Both panels are separated by a narrow white strip. Borders of the image are framed by thick dark gray lines on the left and right sides.
