The image consists of several distinct vertical and diagonal elements. On the far left, there is a vertical dark gray strip running from the top to the bottom. Adjacent to this is a large white triangular section that extends diagonally downward from the top left to the middle right of the image. Within this section, on the lower left side, there is a small part of a logo or graphic in blue, although only a portion is visible so specific details cannot be discerned. On the right side of the image, there is a photograph that appears to depict a close-up of a mechanical or industrial setting, involving what seems to be a hand holding a tool or interacting with machinery part. The image has a greenish tint. The bottom part of this photograph is cut off, and it meets another vertical dark gray strip on the far right, similar in width to the one on the far left. The spatial arrangement forms a symmetrical layout with the photograph positioned between the two gray strips and the central white region.
