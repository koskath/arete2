The image is divided into two main sections. On the left is a data table with a list of countries, numerical data, and color-coded horizontal bar charts. On the right is a map of Europe with countries marked and some filled with distinct colors.

**Left Section - Data Table:**
1. **Title and Options:**
   - At the top left, the title "Totals" is present with a radio button selected next to it.
   - Below that, there are options: "Per country" and "In Progress," each with an unselected radio button.

2. **Filters:**
   - Dropdown filters are displayed at the top: "Country Austria," "Movements Departure," and "Period Last half h." There is a refresh option set to "15 min."

3. **Bar Chart and Data:**
   - The table lists countries vertically on the left with corresponding horizontal bars that vary in color and length on the right, and a numerical value adjacent to each bar.
   - For example:
     - Austria has a bar measuring 40 units in length with an additional number 161 next to it in yellow.
     - Germany has a large purple bar measuring 357 units.
     - Netherlands has a brown bar measuring 298 units.
     - Other countries show a mix of numbers and bar colors, including beige, orange, pink, light blue, and various shades.

4. **Countries with Zero Counts:**
   - Several countries like Cyprus, Georgia, Iceland, Malta, and Portugal have no bar and are associated with a "0" value.

**Right Section - Map of Europe:**
1. **Geographic Layout:**
   - Displays a map of Europe with countries outlined and some filled with different colors.
   - Most countries are shaded in blue or light blue, while some like Ukraine, Georgia, Iceland, and a few others are shaded in distinct colors.

2. **Country Identifications:**
   - Certain countries have flags or icons overlaid.
   - The map shows clear demarcation lines between countries, with no text labels shown on individual countries apart from visual indicators like the flags.

3. **Color Usage:**
   - The countries exhibit a blue color gradient to indicate varying intensities or categories.
   - Countries like Ukraine and Georgia have different colors, possibly highlighting their individual status within the data represented.

Overall, the image combines tabular numerical data with a geographic map to display related information visually.
