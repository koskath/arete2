The image depicts a flowchart with graphical and textual elements on a light gray background surrounded by a thin rectangular border. On the far left, there is a red rectangle representing the Chinese flag, featuring a yellow star accompanied by four smaller stars in a semi-circle formation.

An arrow points rightward from the Chinese flag into a larger light gray rectangle. Inside this rectangle, there are two main processes described, each within separate rounded rectangular boxes:

1. The first box on the left contains the text "Release into free Circulation" above three overlapping black currency symbols, each with an orange euro sign (€) on them.

2. The second box on the right contains the text "Processing in the EU" and has two black gear icons, suggesting industrial processing.

Beneath these boxes are three downward-facing blue arrows:

- The first arrow, located below the "Release into free Circulation" box, points to two overlapping flags: a red rectangle representing the Chinese flag on the left, and a blue rectangle with a circle of yellow stars on the right, symbolizing the European Union (EU) flag. 

- The middle arrow points downward directly below the space between the two main boxes. It ends at an image showing a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass is overlaid on the same overlapping flags as the first arrow.

- The third arrow is below the "Processing in the EU" box and also points to overlapping flags similar to the first and middle arrows, showing the Chinese and EU flags.

All arrows, lines, and graphical symbols are colored blue or black against the light gray background, contributing to a clear visual separation of elements within the flowchart.
