The image shows a composition of four vertical, elongated triangular shapes arranged in a parallel formation. From left to right:

1. A dark gray shape on the far left with no distinct features or shading.
2. A large blue-gray shape with some subtle lighter blue reflections, giving it a glass-like appearance, partially overlapping with the white shape.
3. A narrow white shape acting as a divider between the other shapes.
4. A light green shape slightly overlapping the white, extending upward with no distinct features.
5. Another dark gray shape on the far right, mirroring the first shape, with no distinct features or shading.

The background is a consistent medium gray color.
