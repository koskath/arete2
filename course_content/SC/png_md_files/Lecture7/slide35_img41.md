The image consists of two distinct vertical sections with different contents, each aligned next to the other.

On the left section:
- Predominantly in shades of brown.
- A blurred, elongated vertical shape dominates the leftmost side.
- Several blurred, undefined shapes occupy the middle and right portions.
- There is a vertical white border separating this section from the adjacent right section.

On the right section:
- The right half is mainly in dark turquoise with elements of black and gray.
- A complex structure with vertical and horizontal lines is visible.
- In the lower part of this section, a circular or cylindrical shape is present.
- The words "DESSOUS" and "NOT AUS" are inscribed in black near the bottom of the cylindrical shape.
- There is a dark vertical border on the far right.

The entire image appears to be highly blurred, making specific details and structures indistinct, except for the noted text.
