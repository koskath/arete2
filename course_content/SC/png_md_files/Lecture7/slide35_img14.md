The image consists of two distinct sections divided by a white diagonal line:

1. **Left Section**:
   - Dominated by blue and gray hues.
   - A pattern of intersecting diagonal lines creates a diamond-shaped grid.
   - In the upper-left corner, partial visibility of an object or structure that is indistinct.

2. **Right Section**:
   - Consists of green, black, and dark gray colors.
   - The green area has two visible lines shaped like rectangles or slabs.
   - A black trapezoidal shape at the bottom right contains the white uppercase letters "DEU."
  
Overall, the composition is abstract, with geometric patterns and color blocks creating an unclear image without specific objects or context.
