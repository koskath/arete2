The image depicts a rectangular flag with a red field. In the top left corner, there is a large yellow five-pointed star. To the right of the large star, there are four smaller yellow five-pointed stars. These smaller stars are arranged in a semicircle arc pattern around the larger star. The stars are positioned in such a way that each of the smaller stars has one point directed towards the larger star. The flag’s background is entirely red, completely filling the area around the stars. There are no text, other symbols, or additional markings visible within the image.
