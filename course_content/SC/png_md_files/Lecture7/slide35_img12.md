The image consists of a rectangular composition with a predominantly black background. In the upper left corner, there is a vertical gradient of dark to lighter gray, transitioning from left to right. A sharp diagonal white stripe runs across the lower half of the image from the top right to the bottom left. On the right side, there are multiple thin, parallel darker gray lines against the black background, adding a subtle striped texture. The white stripe creates a contrasting division between the textured black area on the right and the gray gradient on the left.
