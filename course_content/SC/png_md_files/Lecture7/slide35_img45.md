The image consists of three distinct sections arranged horizontally. On the left, there is a vertical rectangle filled with a solid dark gray color. Adjacent to it, towards the right, is a vertically oriented white rectangular area that occupies the center portion of the image. This white rectangle abuts against a large black triangular shape on the far right, which has its base aligned with the bottom edge of the image and its apex extending towards the top. The black triangle features a series of subtle horizontal black lines running across it, adding a textured effect. The overall composition combines these three sections into a cohesive whole, with sharp boundaries separating each color region.
