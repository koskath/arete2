The image contains a partial view of text that appears to be printed on a white surface. The visible text appears in blue capital letters, slightly tilted to the right, and spells the word "INTERNATIONAL" across two lines; the first line contains "INTER" and the second line "NATIONAL UND." The white surface is bordered by a black area on the top-right corner and a beige or light brown area on the left side of the image. The transition between these areas and the text is abrupt, suggesting a cropped or zoomed-in view. The text and areas make the image appear as part of a larger object, possibly a document or a sign, with sections obscured or cut off from view.
