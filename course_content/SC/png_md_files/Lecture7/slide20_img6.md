The image contains two overlapping rectangles, both depicting the flag of the European Union. The flag in the foreground fully displays a blue field with a circle of twelve gold, five-pointed stars. The stars are evenly spaced, forming a complete circle, symbolizing unity. Each star points upward, with one tip facing towards the top of the rectangle. The blue background fills the entire rectangle. Behind this rectangle is another one, slightly larger and offset, partially visible on the left and top sides. This second rectangle appears to be identical in design, with its blue field showing at the edges, and only a portion of the blue and one tip of a star visible, suggesting it is a similar flag positioned behind the first one.
