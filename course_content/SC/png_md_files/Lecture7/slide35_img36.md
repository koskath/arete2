The image is divided into three vertical sections of color, with additional lighter details visible in the leftmost section.

1. **Left Section**:
   - This section is predominantly a dark grey or black vertical shape, occupying the far left of the image.
   - There is a narrow strip of a layered pattern resembling wood or similar texture in shades of brown or tan. This strip is located to the right of the dark section.
   - A white vertical stripe is positioned adjacent to the brown strip, which transitions to a lighter area on the right edge of this section.

2. **Center Section**:
   - A large light blue or teal rectangular shape dominates the center of the image, angled slightly diagonally from the bottom left to the top right.
   - The teal rectangle has a smooth texture without visible patterns or gradients.

3. **Right Section**:
   - On the rightmost portion, a thin vertical border of grey or black that mirrors the leftmost section is visible. It serves as a boundary for the central blue rectangle.

No annotations, labels, or textual elements are present in the image. There are no discernible details of patterns, drawings, or objects beyond these color fields.
