The image shows a partial logo with design elements and text. On the left side, there is a white background featuring a curved section of a blue circle with two visible concentric arcs. To the right, the text "Y" and part of the letter "N" can be seen. The letter "Y" is uniquely designed with its left stem in blue and its right stem in orange. The rest of the visible text is in blue and reads: "f" and "er" with stylized curves. Above the "r," there is a small registered trademark symbol, a circled "R". The image has diagonal black bars at the top and bottom edges, cutting across parts of the design.
