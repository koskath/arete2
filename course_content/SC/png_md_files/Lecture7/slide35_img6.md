The image contains a partial view of a logo or text design on a white background. The text visible includes:

- The number "ISO" in large blue, bold letters.
- Part of the phrase "the International" set in smaller black letters.
- The term "CHAM" in large blue, bold letters, most likely part of a larger word.
  
The text in the image appears to be angled diagonally from the top left to the bottom right. There are gray triangular shapes in the top left and bottom right corners, adding a framing effect around the text elements. The image focuses on the typography and the interplay of bold blue letters with smaller black text on a white and gray background.
