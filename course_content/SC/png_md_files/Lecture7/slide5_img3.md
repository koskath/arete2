The image is divided into two distinct sections. The left section contains a portion of a world map with various colors used to fill different regions, and the right section features a small teal triangle.

On the left section:
- The background is a deep teal blue.
- The map section is predominantly centered, showing the northern part of a continent.
- Two main colors dominate the regions: orange and light blue, signifying different areas.
- The orange regions are primarily on the left side, while the light blue areas are more central and to the right.
- Some regions within the light blue areas are colored white.
- Black outlines distinguish the boundaries between different regions and countries.
- White lines appear sporadically in arcs, likely indicating longitude or latitude lines.
- Smaller orange regions are present adjacent to the larger blue and white areas.

On the right section:
- A single, equilateral triangle is filled with the same teal color as the background on the left.
- The triangle is oriented with the base at the bottom and the apex pointing upwards.
- The triangle has a thin white line running from the apex to the midpoint of the base, dividing it into two smaller triangles.

The entire image is framed with a black rectangular border at the top. The right half of the image is predominantly white space surrounding the teal triangle.
