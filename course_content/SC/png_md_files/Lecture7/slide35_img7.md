The image shows the lower part of a geometric shape, possibly a triangle. The visible portion is a narrow section of gray color aligned diagonally across the top left to the bottom right. In the foreground, overlapping this shape, is text in English. It reads:

"Chamber of Com..."

The text is in black, sans-serif font and appears to be partially cut off, so only a portion of the word "Company" or "Commerce" is visible. The letters are somewhat rotated in alignment with the diagonal orientation of the shape. 

In the upper right corner, there is a partial view of a blue circular or semicircular element, but the shape is not entirely visible. The background is primarily white.
