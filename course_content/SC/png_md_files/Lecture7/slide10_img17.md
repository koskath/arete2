The top part of the "5" is a horizontal straight line leading into a smooth downward curve on the right side, which forms a semicircular loop. The bottom part of the “5” includes a diagonal line descending towards the bottom left, connecting to a horizontal baseline that completes the character. The overall shape is closed, and the font is simple and legible. There are no additional elements, annotations, or markings within the image.
