The image is composed of two sections divided by an angled white space running from the top left to the bottom right of the image.

On the left side:
- A pattern of vertical, blurry, brownish streaks is visible. 
- The streaks vary in thickness, with some appearing dark brown and others lighter.
- This section is bordered on the sides by a narrow vertical black strip to the left and at the diagonal cut by the white space mentioned above.

On the right side:
- A series of vertical, bluish-gray blurry streaks is visible, similar in nature to the left side.
- These streaks also vary in thickness, in shades of gray and blue.
- The section features a narrow vertical black strip on the right side and is cut diagonally by the white space that divides the image.

The top and bottom borders of the image are uniformly black. No annotations, labels, or specific shapes are discernible due to the nature of the blurred effects.
