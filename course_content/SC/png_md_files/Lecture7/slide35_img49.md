The image contains a partial view of a logo. On the left side, there are two stacked wavy, blue elliptical shapes, resembling an abstract representation. Next to these shapes, part of a lowercase letter "l" and possibly the letters "ea" are visible, also in blue, suggesting the continuation of a word. The background is predominantly white, with a gradient gray arc visible at the top. The right side of the image is bordered by a dark gray vertical edge. The spatial arrangement indicates the logo is likely angled slightly in the image, with elements starting from the blue ellipses on the lower left, extending to the letters, and the arc curving above them.
