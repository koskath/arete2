The image appears to be divided into several vertical sections:

1. **Left Section:**
   - A narrow vertical dark gray strip on the far left edge.
   - A segment showing part of a brown-toned object, possibly architectural or machinery, with angular and irregular shapes.
   - Light and shadow create a play on the surface, indicating depth and texture.

2. **Middle Section:**
   - A white central area that separates the left and right segments.
   - Edges of the brown-toned and blue-toned areas seem to converge into this space, forming a clean division.

3. **Right Section:**
   - A light blue object dominates this part of the image, with its surface curving downward from top left to bottom right.
   - A visible shadow or dark mark on this surface, towards the right, near the center bottom.
   - Another narrow vertical dark gray strip on the far right edge.

4. **Overall Composition:**
   - The combined effect of shadows, colors, and forms indicates a possible 3D perspective.
   - Clean edges and the contrasting color palette (brown, white, light blue) create high visual contrast.
   - The sections are distinct, yet integrated into a single, abstract composition.
