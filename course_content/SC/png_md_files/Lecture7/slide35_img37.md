The image consists of three distinct vertical sections. On the left side, there is a dark brown vertical strip. Adjacent to the brown strip is a wide white section that occupies the central part of the image. To the right of the white section is a blue vertical strip, which is slightly curved inward, creating a shape that is narrower at the top and wider at the bottom. The blue strip is placed against a dark gray background present along the right edge. The transitions between the sections are sharp and well-defined, with no additional markings or annotations.
