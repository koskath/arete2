The image features a circular emblem divided into an upper red half and a lower blue half. Inside the red half at the top, the word "AMERICA" is written in bold white capital letters. In the blue half at the bottom, the word "FIRST" is also written in bold white capital letters.

At the center of the circle is a stylized shield. The shield is divided horizontally. The top portion of the shield is blue and contains ten white stars arranged in two staggered rows. The bottom portion of the shield has vertical red and white stripes, arranged alternately. 

The overall design creates a symmetric and balanced appearance, with the central shield connecting the top and bottom text sections. The color scheme is red, white, and blue, reminiscent of the American flag.
