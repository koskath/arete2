The image is circular, featuring the British flag (Union Jack) centrally placed within a glossy sphere. The flag displays its iconic pattern with red, white, and blue colors. Surrounding the sphere is a circular white border containing bold black text along the inner rim. The text on the top half reads "SUPPORT BRITISH INDUSTRY," and on the bottom half, "BUY BRITISH PRODUCTS." The text is evenly spaced, maintaining symmetry in the design. There are small black dots separating the two phrases on either side of the circle, positioned at the horizontal midline of the circular border.
