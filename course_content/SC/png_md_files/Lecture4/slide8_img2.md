The image depicts an antique automobile, specifically an early model car with a classic design often associated with the early 20th century. The car has a distinctive open-top construction with four large black spoked wheels. The front wheels are turned slightly to the left. The front of the car features two prominent brass headlights on either side of the vehicle. The front grille is rectangular with a brass border and a black panel with the word "Ford" in script.

The body of the car is painted predominantly black with a glossy finish, while various brass components, such as the radiator cap and other fittings, provide contrasting highlights. The dashboard and internal framework appear to include wooden elements.

Seating is visible, with a continuous black leather upholstery, and the car includes a rear leather bench-style seat. The steering column is positioned on the right side, reflecting the driving style typical of vehicles from this era. A person in what appears to be period-appropriate white clothing and a large white hat is seated behind the steering wheel.

The surroundings suggest an indoor exhibition setting, with the car placed on a raised white platform. There is an informational plaque positioned in front of the vehicle on a metal stand. The background has a softly lit, neutral-colored wall with minimal visible details. Shadows cast by the car and platform are visible on the ground, indicating focused lighting from above.
