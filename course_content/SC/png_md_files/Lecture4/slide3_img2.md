The image is a black and white portrait of a man from the shoulders up. He is centrally positioned in a square frame with a thin, red outline. The man has a slight smile, short hair that is combed to the side, and a small mustache. He is wearing a high-collared garment, likely a shirt and jacket, and his head is slightly tilted. The background is dark, providing contrast against his lighter-colored face and attire. The lighting highlights the features on the left side of his face, creating gentle shadows on the right.
