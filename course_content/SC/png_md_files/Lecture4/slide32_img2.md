The image depicts a shield-shaped emblem divided into multiple sections. At the top, there is a horizontal black band containing the word "PORSCHE" in gold capital letters. Below, the shield is vertically divided into four quadrants with alternating designs:

1. The top left and bottom right quadrants contain a gold background with three horizontal black antlers each, stylized and aligned in parallel.

2. The top right and bottom left quadrants each feature vertical red and black stripes alternately placed with an overall rectangular pattern.

In the center, there is an additional small black crest with a gold border displaying a rearing horse facing left. Below the horse, the word “STUTTGART” is inscribed in capital letters within the central crest. The emblem has a metallic, glossy appearance with a three-dimensional effect, and each section is bordered distinctly, enhancing the contrast between the gold, black, and red colors used throughout the emblem.
