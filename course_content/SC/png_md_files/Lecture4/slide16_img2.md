The image is a detailed flowchart with various rectangular sections labeled and connected by black lines and arrows indicating flow direction. The sections and their spatial relationships are as follows:

- Top-left section labeled "Raw Stock" connects vertically to "Shear" and horizontally to "Stamp" and "Screw Machine".

- "Shear" is connected downward to "Brake", which connects vertically to "Grind", and horizontally to "Weld". From "Weld", lines lead back to "Grind".

- "Stamp" connects to both "Screw Machine" and "Mill". 

- "Screw Machine" connects vertically and downwards to "Lathe" and "Drill". It also connects horizontally to the right, leading to "Q C" (Quality Control) above and below, and then further right to "Rec" and "Ship".

- "Mill" has connections to "Lathe" and "Drill". "Drill" connects downward to "Finish".

- "Finish" connects horizontally to the right, leading to "Parts Stock" and upward to the right joining with "Assembly".

- "Parts Stock" connects vertically upwards to "Assembly".

- The upper row includes "Q C" connected to "Rec", with lines heading further right to "Ship".

- "Ship" located top-right, with multiple upward arrows representing output lines.

- Separate section labeled "Assembly" connects right to another "Q C" block.

- Multiple black arrows from different sections converge and direct towards the section labeled "Ship".

- Bottom-right includes forklift imagery, with no lines connecting to main sections.

All sections are colored dark gray, except for "Ship" outputs, which have one arrow shaded white and others in varying shades of gray.
