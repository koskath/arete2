The image contains a detailed chart titled "The Art and Science of Shoveling." It features a central line graph, illustrations of shovels, and annotations.

### Line Graph
- **Axes**: 
  - The horizontal axis is labeled "Shovel Load in pounds," marked at intervals from 5 to 40.
  - The vertical axis on the left is labeled in pounds, ranging from 20 to 60. The labels include: 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 48, 50, 55, 60.

- **Graph Line**: 
  - Starts at approximately 10 pounds on the vertical axis when the horizontal axis is at 40 pounds.
  - Rises to a peak near 24 pounds on the vertical axis when the horizontal axis is roughly 21.5 pounds.
  - Declines back to the initial level as it approaches 5 pounds on the horizontal axis.

### Annotations
- **Above the Graph**:
  - "The Art and Science of Shoveling" is written prominently at the top center.
  - A section listing numerical data:
    - "Number of laborers" with specifics "Old way"—500 and "New way"—1400.
    - "Cost per man per day" as "Old way"—16c and "New way"—9c.
    - "Earnings per man per day" — "Old way"—1.15s and "New way"—1.88s.
    - "Cost per ton" — "Old way"—0.072 and "New way"—0.033.
  - A note on the graph itself reads, "21 ½ lbs optimum shovel load for any material."

- **Right Side**:
  - Illustrations of five shovels showing different designs. 
  - A caption states, "The correspondent different kinds of shovels."
