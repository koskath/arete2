The image is a sepia-toned portrait of an older man posed from the waist up. He wears a dark, three-piece suit, including a jacket, waistcoat, and tie. The jacket is buttoned, and the shirt underneath the waistcoat is white. His hair is light and neatly combed back. The background is dark, creating a contrast with his lighter-colored suit and hair. Below the portrait is a white area with a handwritten signature located centrally that reads "Henry Ford." The overall appearance of the image has a classic, formal feel, befitting a historical portrait.
