The image is an advertisement for the "Wyoming 21-Pound Load Shovel." 

Starting at the top, the headline reads, "Give Him a 21-Pound Load Shovel," followed by the subheading, "He'll Double your Results." Below this is a descriptive text: "The Wyoming 21-Pound Load shovel is a shovel which is designed to hold an average of 21 pounds a load."

To the right is an illustration of a worker in a cap, long-sleeved shirt, pants, and boots. He is holding a shovel tilted downward, appears to be mid-stride, and facing left. The background includes indistinct shapes suggestive of an industrial setting, with architectural elements sketched behind him.

Next to this illustration, the ad mentions "Frederick W. Taylor—the man who first made 'scientific management' popular—demonstrates beyond doubt that this shovel does his workers' larger work when his average is 21 pounds."

Further down, the text continues, detailing Taylor’s experiments with Wyoming Shovels and inviting customers to "cash in on his discovery by adopting" these shovels. There is a prominent label, "WYOMING '21 POUND LOAD' SHOVELS," centered within a rectangular frame. 

The smaller print in the lower portion discusses Taylor's specific experiments and findings regarding shovel loads and efficiency, referencing the Bethlehem Steel Works and describing the productivity improvements achieved.

Centered towards the bottom is a call-to-action section, titled in quotes as "'Scientific Shoveling' Send for a Copy," promoting the availability of illustrative material. Below this is the contact information: "The Wyoming Shovel Works, Wyoming, Penna."

On the lower right, there is an additional inset with a block labeled "SCIENTIFIC SHOVELING" and a simple graphic resembling a shovel blade with the word "WYOMING" beneath it.
