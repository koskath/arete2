2. **Red Region**: This section encompasses the African continent, occupying the central southern part of the map. It shows the landmass of Africa prominently highlighted in red.

3. **Yellow Region**: The yellow section covers the vast expanse of Asia, positioned in the northeastern part of the map. It extends from the Middle East across to the eastern edge of the continent toward the Pacific Ocean.

4. **Purple Region**: This part of the map includes Europe, located just west of Asia and north of Africa. It is situated in the north-central part of the map.

5. **Gray Region**: Positioned to the southeast, this region includes Australia and the islands of the surrounding Oceania. It is the smallest of the regions presented on the map.

There are no labels, text annotations, or additional markings other than the color distinctions. The map is set against a plain white background, emphasizing the division by color.
