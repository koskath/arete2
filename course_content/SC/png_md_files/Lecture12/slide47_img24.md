The image is composed of vertical stripes of varying colors and thicknesses. Starting from the left, there is a very narrow white stripe, followed by a slightly wider black stripe. After this, there are several blue stripes, ranging in shades from light blue to dark blue. These blues transition into gray stripes of varying darkness. Some stripes are distinctly dark gray, while others are lighter. The spacing between them and their respective widths vary, some stripes are broad while others are thin. Moving to the right, there is a mixture of both narrow and wide stripes, alternating primarily between shades of blue and gray, with the overall transition appearing to shift gradually from left to right.
