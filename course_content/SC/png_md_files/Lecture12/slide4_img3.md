The image consists of a series of arrow diagrams, labels, and boxes. 

- In the top left corner, a labeled box titled "Readiness" contains two lines of curved, staggered gray arrows pointing down and right, labeled “Process” and “Costumer.”

- Below, the main section is divided horizontally into three rows, each with differently colored arrow sequences arranged horizontally.

1. **Order-Entry**: 
   - Three orange arrows aligned horizontally.
   - Above this sequence is the label "Order-Entry."

2. **Order Fulfilment**: 
   - Consists of three blue arrows aligned horizontally in parallel with the order-entry arrows.
   - The arrows are enclosed on top and bottom by thick red curved arrows connecting from left to right, creating a loop.
   - The label "Order Fulfilment" is placed above these arrows, in the space between the Order-Entry and Order Fulfilment rows.

3. **Payment-Flow**: 
   - Contains three pink arrows.
   - A thick red arrow loops over the payment-flow arrows, connecting the end of the arrows to their start.
   - The label "Payment-Flow" is placed above these arrows.

- On the far right, aligned vertically, is a gray box labeled "Costumer/ Market."

- Beneath these rows, in the bottom left, is another box divided into two rows within its border. The box is labeled at the top left “Controlling,” including:
  
  - Upper row: Features three gray, horizontal arrows with the label "Controlling."
  - Lower row: Contains a sequence of gray arrows pointing right, labeled "Plans/ Budget."

- Various curved arrows connect the ends and beginnings of different stages, indicating a flow or cycle through the sequences.

The background is primarily white with black text for labels, and various colored arrows demarcating specific processes or flows.
