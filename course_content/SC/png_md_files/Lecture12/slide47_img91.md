The image consists of vertical gradient bands transitioning smoothly from left to right. On the far left, the color is a very dark gray, almost black. Moving towards the center, the bands become progressively lighter, transitioning through shades of gray. The color continues to lighten, reaching a light gray around the right-middle area. As the bands approach the far right, they become even lighter, transitioning into a nearly white color. The gradients exhibit smooth transitions without any sharp edges or defined separations between them. The entire image is composed of these vertically oriented, evenly distributed bands.
