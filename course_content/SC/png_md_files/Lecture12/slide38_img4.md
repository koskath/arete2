The image features a lantern with a cuboid shape, suspended outdoors. The lantern has a wooden frame with vertical and horizontal panels. The front panel, which is visible, appears to be made of a translucent material, possibly paper, and displays calligraphic text in Japanese kanji and kana characters. The text is written in black ink in a flowing script, with some characters larger than others. Just below the center of this panel, there is a faint blue outline of a stylized, circular shape, resembling a gourd or similar object. 

The lantern is supported by dark wooden corner posts, and there are visible horizontal beams or straps near the top. The top section of the lantern is also framed, with a dark upper surface. The lantern is positioned on a city street, and part of the sidewalk and road are visible in the background. The surrounding area appears to be blurred, focusing attention on the lantern itself. There appears to be another similar lantern visible partially to the right, indicated by similar wooden framing and design.
