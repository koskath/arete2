The image displays a series of vertical bands that are closely aligned from left to right across the entire image. The bands vary in color and tone, consisting predominantly of shades of blue, black, and gray. The leftmost section contains a thin black band. Moving towards the right, there is a sequence of blue tones ranging from light to dark. In the central area, broad bands of gray and dark blue dominate, interspersed with a few lighter blue lines. Toward the right side, there are increasingly darker bands, predominantly consisting of dark blues and grays, ultimately becoming a deep black at the far right edge. The width of the bands varies, with some being thinner and others wider, creating a pattern of alternating hues and intensities across the image. The overall effect is a gradient-like abstraction running vertically throughout.
