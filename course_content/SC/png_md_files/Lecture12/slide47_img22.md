The image contains a series of vertical stripes of varying widths and colors. From left to right, the sequence of colors begins with a narrow dark stripe followed by a slightly wider dark stripe. Next is a series of blue stripes, starting with a narrow deep blue moving to lighter shades of blue in varying widths. This is followed by a much wider section of light blue or grey.

In the middle, there is a notable yellowish stripe, narrow in width, flanked by grey on either side. Further towards the right, there is a sequence of darker stripes, varying from grey to black, at differing widths.

Overall, the pattern consists of a gradual transition from darker shades on the left to lighter and more varied tones in the center, before returning to darker hues on the right. The entire image is composed of these linear, unmixed color bands with a smooth gradient across each segment.
