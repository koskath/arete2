The image consists of a series of vertical lines that create a striped pattern. There are various shades of gray, black, and white. The lines vary in width and are parallel to each other, running vertically throughout the entire image. There's a dominant dark gray column on the left, followed by alternating thinner black and lighter gray stripes. Towards the right, the pattern becomes more irregular with some lines appearing slightly blurred or blended, giving a gradient effect. The rightmost edge of the image features a thin white band. The overall appearance is abstract and symmetrical.
