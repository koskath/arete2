The image consists of a repeated vertical pattern with alternating colors. In the center, there is a prominent white vertical stripe. This white stripe is flanked on both sides by dark gray and black vertical stripes, creating alternating bands. The black and dark gray stripes vary slightly in width and hue, contributing to the striped appearance. The overall impression is of a series of long, narrow, vertical lines spanning the entire height of the image, aligned closely without gaps.
