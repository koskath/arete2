The image consists of a Venn diagram with two overlapping circles. The circle on the left is filled with a solid yellow color and outlined with a thin black line. The circle on the right is filled with a solid light blue color and also outlined with a thin black line. The two circles overlap, creating a lens-shaped area in the center where the yellow and blue colors blend to form a green color. This overlapping area indicates the intersection of the two sets represented by the circles. The circles are positioned such that the majority of the yellow circle is on the left and the majority of the blue circle is on the right. The lines delineating each circle are smooth and form perfect circular shapes. There are no additional markings, text, or annotations within the diagram.
