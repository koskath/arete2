A series of vertical lines fill the image. The lines are various shades of black and dark gray, creating a gradient effect from left to right. The transition between the colors is smooth, and no distinct shapes, annotations, or additional elements are present. The lines are evenly spaced and extend from the top to the bottom of the image without interruption. The background color is white on the far right edge, contrasting the dark gradient of the lines.
