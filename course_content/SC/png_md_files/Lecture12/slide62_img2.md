The image displays a simplified, stylized icon of a person represented by a blue-colored figure. The figure consists of two main parts: a circular head and a torso. 

- **Head**: The head is depicted as a solid blue circle situated at the top center of the figure. 

- **Torso**: The torso is a larger shape beneath the head. It is rounded and bell-like in form, wider at the bottom and narrowing slightly as it connects to the head. The top edges curve smoothly towards the central head, and its color matches the blue of the head.

The figure is shown without distinct facial features, limbs, or any other intricate details. There is a black outline around both the head and torso, providing definition against a plain background. The overall design is simplistic and iconic.
