The image consists of two vertically stacked bar charts, each with a title and an axis labeled "Zeit KW" with an arrow pointing to the right.

**Top Bar Chart:**
- Title: "Benötigte Kapazität in h pro Kalenderwoche."
- Contains six vertical bars.
- Bars are sequentially numbered from 1 to 6 from left to right.
- All six bars are of equal height.
- The bars are shaded inside a rectangular border.

**Bottom Bar Chart:**
- Title: "Bereits belegte Kapazität in h pro Kalenderwoche."
- Contains six vertical bars with varying heights.
- Bars are sequentially numbered from 1 to 6 from left to right.
- A dashed horizontal line runs across the bars, labeled "100 %."
- Bar 1 reaches just below the dashed line.
- Bars 2 and 3 are of equal height and lower than Bar 1.
- Bar 4 is slightly lower than Bar 3.
- Bar 5 is shorter than Bar 4.
- Bar 6 is the shortest, significantly lower than Bar 5.
- All bars are outlined with black borders.

Both bar charts share the same horizontal axis labeled "Zeit KW," with an arrow pointing to the right at the end of the axis. The y-axis on each chart is not explicitly labeled with values, but the top chart titles imply measurement in hours per calendar week.
