The image is a vertical gradient with smooth transitions between shades of grayscale colors. On the left side, the color is a very dark black, almost pure black. As it progresses towards the right, it gradually transitions to lighter shades of grey. The midpoint features a medium grey tone, indicating the halfway transition between black and white. Continuing further to the right, the gradient becomes increasingly lighter, eventually merging into a very pale grey, and finally transitioning to pure white at the extreme right edge. The gradient is smooth, with no distinct lines or separations between the color transitions. The overall composition is uniform in texture, with no additional markings, annotations, or structures present within the image.
