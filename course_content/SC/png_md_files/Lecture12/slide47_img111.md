The image shows a close-up of a small, rectangular, white card placed on a larger, light brown surface, likely a corrugated cardboard box. On the white card, there is a symmetrical pattern consisting of brown conductive traces. The pattern is composed of two identical, opposing shapes, each resembling a bow tie or butterfly with widely curved ends. Each shape consists of two symmetrical, outward-curving arcs connected at their tips and narrowing toward the center. In the middle, the two shapes are joined, creating a small, rectangular bridge. The pattern appears to be an RFID tag or similar electronic component, designed for signal transmission or reception. The card is oriented diagonally on the box, positioned in a way that one corner is at the bottom left and the opposing corner is at the top right. The shadows and angles suggest a light source coming from above and slightly to the right.
