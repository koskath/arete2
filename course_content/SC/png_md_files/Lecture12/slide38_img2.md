The image is a cartoon-style illustration depicting a workplace scene. 

- At the center-left, three workers are standing in a line behind a long table or conveyor belt, each engaging with a rectangular piece on the table. They have simple, triangular heads with prominent noses, and they appear to be focused on their tasks.
  
- Above the second worker from the left, there's a vertical rectangular panel labeled "Stop button for the line supervisor" with three circular buttons stacked vertically.

- Above the conveyor belt, a large rectangular display labeled "Andon" shows twelve numbered sections arranged in two rows of six. The numbers 1 to 12 are in each section. The number 5 is highlighted or appears to be lit up, as it is distinct from the others.

- To the right, facing the workers, stands a person labeled "Supervisor," identified by their suit and clipboard. This person has a thought bubble, conveying the word "Abnormality," indicating their apprehension or concern.

- At the bottom of the illustration, there is a caption: "Figure 14. The Easy-to-Observe Workplace."

The overall scene represents a structured and monitored workplace environment, focusing on visibility, communication, and alert mechanisms.
