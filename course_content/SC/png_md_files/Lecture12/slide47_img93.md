The image consists of vertical gradient stripes that progress from left to right. On the far left, the image begins with a deep black color that transitions to dark gray and then progresses to lighter shades of gray. Moving towards the center, the gradient becomes lighter, transitioning from medium gray to soft gray. Continuing to the right, it further lightens, becoming very light gray and eventually white as it reaches the far right. The entire pattern has a smooth gradient transition without distinct lines separating the different shades, giving a seamless appearance across the image.
