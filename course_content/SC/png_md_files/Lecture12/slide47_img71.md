The image consists of vertical lines that blend from dark to light shades. The lines vary in width and transition smoothly from black on the edges to shades of gray and white toward the center. This creates a gradient effect. The lines are closely spaced, and the overall appearance is abstract with a strong contrast between the dark and light areas. The central part is mostly white, with the darker lines framing it, creating a symmetrical pattern. The texture appears smooth with a fluid, streaked visual effect.
