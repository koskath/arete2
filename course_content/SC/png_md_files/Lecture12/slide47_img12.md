The image consists of a series of vertical stripes that vary in width and color. The stripes cover the entire image from top to bottom. Starting from the left, there is a thin black stripe, followed by a slightly wider white stripe. Next, there is a sequence of stripes in shades of grey, ranging from dark to light, with some stripes being more blue-tinted. Towards the right, there are repeated sequences of these grey and blue-tinted stripes, interspersed with thin black and white lines. The overall pattern is regular, with the stripes arranged parallel to one another, creating a barcode-like appearance. The intensity of the colors and the variations in width contribute to a gradated, textured effect across the image.
