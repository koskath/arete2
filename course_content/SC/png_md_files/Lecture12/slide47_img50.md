The image consists of vertical stripes of varying widths. There are four distinct stripes. The first stripe on the left is a dark gray. Next to it is a much narrower stripe that appears gradient, transitioning from light gray near the center to white towards the edges. The third stripe is a wide dark gray, similar in color to the first stripe, but slightly lighter. Finally, the rightmost stripe is a narrow white one, sharply contrasting with the adjacent wider dark gray stripe. The background appears to be uniformly off-white, but no additional elements or textures are visible.
