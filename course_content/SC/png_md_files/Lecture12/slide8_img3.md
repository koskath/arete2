The image contains portions of three intersecting circles with visible overlapping areas. The circles are filled with different semi-transparent colors. 

1. **Large Circle in Foreground**: 
   - Positioned in the lower part of the image.
   - Filled with a light green color.
   - Bold black border defining the circle's perimeter.
   - Partially overlaps with the other circles.

2. **Top Left Circle**:
   - Positioned partially outside the top left of the large green circle.
   - Filled with a light yellow color.
   - Black border is partially visible.
   - Intersects with the large green circle, forming an overlapping area of a different shade.

3. **Top Right Circle**:
   - Positioned partially outside the top right of the large green circle.
   - Filled with a light blue color.
   - Black border is partially visible.
   - Intersects with the large green circle, creating another overlapping area of a different shade.
  
4. **Overlap Areas**:
   - The intersection of the top left (yellow) circle and the large (green) circle creates a light yellow-green overlapping area.
   - The intersection of the top right (blue) circle and the large (green) circle creates a light blue-green overlapping area.
   - The areas where all three circles overlap result in a distinct shade visible between them.

All circles have black outlines that enhance the boundaries and intersections between them, making overlaps distinctly noticeable.
