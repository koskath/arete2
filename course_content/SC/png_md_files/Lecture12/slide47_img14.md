The image consists of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths, arranged side by side. From left to right, the colors transition gradually. Starting with dark navy blue stripes, which change to softer blue shades. These stripes are prominent in the left third of the image. Adjacent to the blues, there are a series of lighter blue and gray stripes in the middle portion. Moving further right, the colors become increasingly dominated by darker gray tones, interspersed with thinner black stripes. There is a small section with a mild purplish hue among the grays before the colors transition into more medium and light gray towards the right edge. The arrangement is consistent in terms of height, with all stripes spanning the entire height of the image, creating a seamless appearance. The pattern lacks any text, symbols, or numbers, focusing purely on the color transition aspect.
