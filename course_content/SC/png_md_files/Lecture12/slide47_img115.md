The image consists of a white triangular shape with three sides and three vertices. The background is gray. The bottom of the triangle is a slanted line, creating a right angle at the top left corner. The hypotenuse slopes downward to the right, and the short base starts from the bottom left corner and slopes upwards to meet the right vertex. The edges are sharp and delineate the white interior from the gray background, creating a clean contrast. There are no annotations, text, or additional elements visible within or around the shape.
