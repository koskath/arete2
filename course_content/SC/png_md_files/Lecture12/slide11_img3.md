The image is a product structure diagram with a hierarchical layout representing parts for a snow shovel. It is labeled “FIGURE 2.4 Parts for snow shovel” at the top.

1. At the top of the hierarchy:
   - A rectangle labeled “1605 Shovel complete.”

2. Below “1605 Shovel complete,” there is a line that branches into five sub-components, each represented by a rectangle. From left to right, they are:
   - “13122 Top handle assembly”
   - “048 Scoop-shaft connector”
   - “116 Shaft”
   - “082 Nail (two required)”
   - “14127 Rivet (four required)”
   - “314 Scoop assembly”

3. Under “13122 Top handle assembly,” the line branches into three rectangles:
   - “457 Top handle”
   - “082 Nail (two required),” which connects directly below.
   - “11495 Bracket assembly,” which further branches downwards into:
      - “129 Top handle bracket”
      - “1118 Top handle coupling”

4. Under “314 Scoop assembly,” the line branches into three rectangles:
   - “2142 Scoop-”
   - “019 Blade”
   - “14127 Rivet (six required)”

The rectangles are connected by straight lines showing the hierarchical relationships, with connectors branching out to illustrate components that make up each assembly.
