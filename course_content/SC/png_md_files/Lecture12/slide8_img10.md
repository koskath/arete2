The image contains a flowchart illustrating a process with three main rectangular nodes connected sequentially, representing the stages of the process. The flowchart is structured vertically and consists of the following elements:

1. **Top Node**:
   - A rectangle labeled "Order Placed."
   - Contains an icon of a package.

2. **Middle Node**:
   - Directly below the top node, connected by a downward arrow.
   - A rectangle labeled "Processing."
   - Contains a gear icon indicating an operational phase.

3. **Bottom Node**:
   - Positioned directly below the middle node, connected by another downward arrow.
   - A rectangle labeled "Shipped."
   - Contains a truck icon representing transportation or delivery.

Additional elements:
- The overall background is white.
- The arrows connecting the nodes are simple straight lines with arrowheads pointing downward, indicating the flow from one stage to the next. 

The flowchart visually represents a linear progression from "Order Placed" to "Processing" and finally to "Shipped," signifying the steps involved in an order fulfillment process.
