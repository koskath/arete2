FIGURE 2.6
Title: "Gantt chart for cutting approach to snow shovel problem (front or earliest start schedule)"

The chart is divided into multiple rows, each representing a specific task with corresponding time durations. The horizontal axis represents "Time (days)" ranging from 0 to 20, marked with small increments. Each task is represented by a horizontal bar with white rectangles indicating the duration and specific days on which the task occurs. Arrows show the dependency between tasks.

Tasks:

1. **129 Top handle bracket (1 day)**
   - A small bar starting at day 0, ending at day 1.

2. **1149S Bracket assembly (3 days)**
   - A bar starting just after day 1, continuing until day 4.

3. **1118 Top handle coupling (10 days)**
   - A longer bar starting around day 0, extending to day 10.

4. **13122 Top handle assembly (5 days)**
   - Starts after "Bracket assembly" ends, around day 4, and ends at day 9. An arrow points from "Top handle coupling" to this task.

5. **457 Top handle (7 days)**
   - Begins slightly before day 0 and continues to day 7.

6. **019 Blade (11 days)**
   - Starts at day 0 and extends to day 11.

7. **314 Scoop assembly (2 days)**
   - Starts at day 15 and ends at day 17. An arrow points from "Scoop" to this task.

8. **2142 Scoop (15 days)**
   - Starts at day 0 and ends at day 15.

9. **1605 Complete shovel (4 days)**
   - Starts at day 16 and ends at day 20. An arrow points from "Scoop assembly" to this task.

10. **118 Shaft (13 days)**
   - Begins at day 0 and ends at day 13.

11. **048 Scoop-shaft connector (5 days)**
   - Starts at day 0 and ends at day 5.

12. **082 Nail (1 day)**
   - A small bar starting at day 0, ending just after day 1.

13. **4127 Rivet (4 days)**
   - Starts just after day 1, ends at day 5.

The tasks and dependencies are laid out clearly, with visual separation between each bar and arrows indicating task dependencies.
