The image consists of a series of vertical stripes filling the entire frame. These stripes vary in color from left to right. Starting from the left, the colors include light blue, transitioning to medium blue and dark blue. The midsection features a mix of grays, with some stripes appearing in dark gray and others in lighter shades. Toward the right side, there are several darker bands, including deep reds and more dark gray tones. The stripes are evenly spaced, with no gaps in between, creating a continuous pattern across the entire image. The background appears to be blended with the stripes, providing no distinct background separation. The entire composition forms a vertically oriented striped pattern.
