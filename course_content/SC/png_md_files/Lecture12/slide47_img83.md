The image consists of vertical streaks and gradients of color. It primarily features shades of black, gray, and white. On the left side, there are dark black vertical streaks that gradually transition to lighter shades as they move toward the center of the image. In the center, the colors become lighter, with a mix of gray and white, creating a gradient effect. As the image moves to the right, the colors darken again into various shades of gray and black. This creates a symmetrical pattern of alternating light and dark vertical sections. There are no visible annotations, shapes, or other structures apart from these vertical streaks.
