The image consists of a series of vertical colored stripes arranged side by side, each stripe having a consistent width from top to bottom. The sequence of colors transitions gradually from left to right across a spectrum. 

- On the leftmost side, the stripes are predominantly dark with deep shades of blue. Some stripes contain subtle hints of black.
- Moving towards the center, the blue shades lighten progressively, incorporating lighter shades of blue mixed with occasional light gray stripes.
- Closer to the center, a distinct vertical stripe of pale cream or light yellow is visible, providing a stark contrast amid the dominant blues and grays.
- To the right of the cream stripe, the colors revert back to a combination of various gray tones interspersed with very dark blue and near-black hues.
- The rightmost section consists of darker gray and black stripes with less variation in hue.

The pattern does not display any text, numbers, or other symbols. The transitions between colors are smooth, and there are no visible borders or separations between the stripes. The arrangement creates an aesthetic gradient effect across the image.
