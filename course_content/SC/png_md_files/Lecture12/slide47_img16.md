The stripes display a gradient of colors, starting from deep black on the far left, followed by a transition into various shades of blue, ranging from dark navy to lighter blues. Continuing from the blues, there are some distinct pinkish stripes, transitioning into shades of gray. The grays range from dark to light, and the sequence concludes with additional black and dark gray stripes on the far right. Each stripe is uniform in height and fills the entire height of the image, maintaining a consistent pattern throughout the sequence. The overall arrangement demonstrates a smooth color transition across the stripe pattern.
