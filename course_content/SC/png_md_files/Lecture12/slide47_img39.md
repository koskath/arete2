The image shows a vertical rectangular structure with a smooth gradient texture. The left side of the rectangle features dark shades of gray to black, giving a sense of depth and shadow. As the gradient moves from left to right, it transitions through various tones of gray, gradually becoming lighter until it reaches a medium to light gray near the right edge. The far right side of the rectangle has a thin vertical strip of bright white, sharply contrasting with the gray tones. The gradient appears seamless and evenly distributed across the width of the rectangle. No other elements, annotations, or markings are present in this structure.
