The image consists of vertical stripes of varying widths and colors. Starting from the left, there is a narrow black stripe, followed by a wider dark gray stripe. Next, a sequence of blue stripes appears: a light blue stripe, followed by two slightly darker blue stripes, and then a dark blue stripe. On the right of the blue stripes is a gradient transitioning from dark gray on the left side to black on the right. This section holds the largest portion of the image. All the stripes extend vertically across the entire height of the image, creating a barcode-like pattern. The colors blend smoothly at their boundaries, creating subtle transitions. The overall composition is linear and abstract, with a focus on the play of colors and widths.
