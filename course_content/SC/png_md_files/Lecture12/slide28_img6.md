The image is a square with a gradient fill. The gradient transitions diagonally from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. In the bottom left corner, the color is a deep black. As it progresses towards the top right, the color shifts smoothly through dark shades, gradually becoming a medium blue towards the top right corner. The gradient transition appears smooth with no distinct or harsh lines separating the colors. The overall appearance creates a subtle blending effect from dark to lighter shades within the square.
