The image features an overhead view of a large container ship labeled "MAERSK LINE" on its side, navigating through the ocean. The ship is loaded with numerous stacks of multicolored shipping containers arranged in rows. Each container is uniformly rectangular, with visible variation in colors including white, red, and gray. 

Several annotations with dotted lines point to different parts of the ship, providing data and measurements related to the ship's technology and operations:

1. On the top left, an annotation reads "0.05 seconds between each motion measurement on a ship," with a dotted line pointing to a cluster of containers.
2. To the right, another annotation states, "2,800 sensors hardwired into the Triple E vessel's main control system," with a dotted line aimed at the center of the container stacks.
3. "5,000 data tags on a modern vessel," is annotated with a line pointing towards the back part of the containers.
4. On the far right, "30 TB data transmitted by the Maersk Line fleet over satellite link every month," is noted with a line pointing to the upper right side of the containers.
5. Below this, "2 TB data generated every 10 days by a modern vessel," is noted with a line pointing downward to the mid-section of the ship.
6. Towards the lower left, near the side of the ship, an annotation states, "7,000 channels monitored on the Triple E for situational awareness and alarms."
7. Moving downward, another annotation notes, "200 sensors in a modern main engine room measuring temperature, pressure and operations," with a line pointing towards the base area.
8. Toward the bottom left of the image, "2 GB data stored every day from the main control systems of a Triple E vessel," is annotated with a line pointing downward.

The ocean appears darker around the hull of the ship, with visible wake indicating movement through the water. The ship's bridge, located at the front center, is painted a cream color with various structural elements and antennas visible.
