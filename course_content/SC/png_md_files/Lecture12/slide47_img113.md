The image shows a close-up view of a cardboard box with a white rectangular label attached to its surface. The label features a brown, symmetrical shape resembling an antenna or circuit pattern. The pattern consists of two sets of curved, wing-like structures, one on the left and one on the right, connected by a central narrow band.

Each wing-like structure appears to have a solid brown outer border and is filled with a mesh of fine, brown lines creating a grid-like pattern. The central band has a uniform brown color without any grid lines. The overall design is positioned diagonally across the label, with one pair of curved structures extending towards the upper-left corner and the other towards the lower-right corner.

The box surface around the label is predominantly brown, typical of a cardboard texture. There are subtle variations in shading on the box, suggesting lighting effects or natural texture. The edges of the label are aligned parallel to the box’s edges.
