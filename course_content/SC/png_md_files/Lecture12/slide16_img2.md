The image shows a bar chart with seven vertical bars, each representing a consecutive segment, numbered 1 to 7 along the x-axis. The x-axis is labeled "Zeit KW" with an arrow pointing to the right. The y-axis is labeled "Summe der Kapazität in h" with an arrow pointing upward. 

The heights of the bars decrease in a step-like pattern from left to right. Each bar is colored in light gray and has a thin black outline. A horizontal dashed line labeled "100 %" runs across the chart. The line passes through the top portion of several bars, intersecting the fifth and sixth bars at mid-height. 

The exact heights of the bars are not quantified with numbers, but visually, the first bar is the tallest, with its top slightly above the dashed line. The second bar is shorter than the first, also slightly above the dashed line. The third bar is slightly shorter than the second, matching the dashed line. The fourth bar matches the height of the second bar, above the dashed line. The fifth bar is slightly shorter than the fourth, with its top exactly at the dashed line. The sixth bar is nearly the same height as the fifth, intersecting slightly above the dashed line. The seventh bar is the shortest, with its top below the dashed line.
