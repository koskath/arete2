The image shows a brown and white rectangular label affixed to a larger rectangular cardboard surface, which is partially visible. The label features a distinct symmetrical design in brown on a white background, resembling a stylized bowtie or butterfly shape. The design consists of two sets of mirrored shapes on either side of a central vertical axis.

Each side of the design features what appears to be a pair of curved, elongated, and tapered shapes that together form a semicircle facing outward from the center. These shapes have a border and contain intricate inner patterns with thin lines that follow the contour of the outer shape and an additional set of parallel lines forming a secondary pattern inside.

At the center of the design, a narrow brown vertical rectangle connects the two sets of mirrored shapes on either side, creating unity in the design. The white region surrounding the brown design is clean and uncluttered, with the label edges clearly visible against the background of the cardboard surface. The cardboard is light brown, and the texture and edges of the cardboard are also visible. The entire scene is lit from above, casting subtle shadows on the cardboard around the edges of the label.
