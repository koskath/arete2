The image features a vertical arrangement of bands with varying colors and widths. Starting from the left, it consists of a narrow black band adjacent to a slightly wider band in light blue. This is followed by a narrow dark blue band, a broad light blue band, and another narrow dark blue band. Continuing to the right, there is a medium-width band of black, a broad band of medium gray, a slightly narrower dark gray band, and a larger dark gray band. Finally, there is a thin strip of black along the right edge. The bands are smoothly blended, creating a gradient effect in some areas. The background appears consistent and continuous throughout the image.
