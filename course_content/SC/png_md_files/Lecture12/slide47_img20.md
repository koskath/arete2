The image consists of multiple vertical stripes of varying widths and colors aligned closely together, spanning the entire width of the image. Starting from the left, the colors begin with a dark blue stripe, adjacent to a lighter blue stripe. This is followed by stripes in various shades of blue, transitioning from dark to light tones. Near the center, there is a narrow band of off-white or beige, flanked by more blue stripes. Towards the right side, the blue shades become darker again, with several thin stripes of different blue hues interspersed. The far right features a stripe in a very dark, almost black blue. Each stripe is uniform in color vertically, creating a barcode-like pattern across the image. There are no annotations, labels, or other visible markings.
