A vertical gradient transition is displayed across the image. On the left side, the image starts with a dark gray color that gradually lightens as it moves to the right. The gradient smoothly progresses through various shades: dark gray softens into a medium gray, further transitioning into lighter grays. Near the center, the gradient becomes a very light gray. Continuing rightward, the light gray transitions into off-white, and finally, on the extreme right, the image finishes with a pure white section. The gradient creates a continuous and seamless color transition from dark to light across the entire frame.
