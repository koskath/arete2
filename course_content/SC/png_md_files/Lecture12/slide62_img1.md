The image consists of several interconnected shapes and annotations. 

On the left side, there is a large, oval-shaped area with two overlapping regions:
1. An orange region labeled “„thing“”.
2. A green region labeled “„smart“” which lies beneath the orange region, partially overlapping with it.

To the right of these two regions, there is a light teal-colored, irregularly-shaped area with a thick, dark outline. Within this area, there are several elements:

- At the top center, there is an irregular shape outlined in dark color containing the text “Needs along the life cycle process”.
  
- Below this text, still within the light teal area, is another irregularly-shaped enclosure with the text: 
  “Solutions delivered by different types of solution providers based on internet and Cyber-Physical Systems technologies”.

- To the right of this text, there is a stylized icon resembling a blue person or avatar with a darker outline.

- Extending from the “Solutions” text is a long arrow pointing towards the right, which leads to a rectangular shape with rounded corners. This rectangle contains the text “Solution provider”.

In the bottom left corner, partially cut off, is the phrase “cycle of the er-Physical system” within a rectangular label.

Separating the areas and text are various curved lines and arrows, connecting the different components throughout the image. The entire illustration is set against a plain white background.
