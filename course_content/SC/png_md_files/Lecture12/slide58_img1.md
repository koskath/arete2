A pair of hands wearing red gloves is handling items inside a black storage bin. The gloves are smooth and cover the hands completely. One hand holds a small, transparent plastic container that appears to have some internal compartments and a green object inside, possibly electronic or mechanical components. The other hand points towards the container. The bin contains multiple large, metallic bolts with hexagonal heads, arranged close together. In the background, there are several black storage units or bins, each with a white label or screen, and a small, darker rectangular area beneath the label, possibly for displaying information. The labels on these storage units are not legible in detail. The scene suggests an organized storage or inventory management setting.
