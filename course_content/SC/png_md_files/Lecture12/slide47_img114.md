The image features a black background with a series of parallel, evenly spaced, vertical white lines. These lines are uniformly aligned, starting at the top left corner and extending towards the bottom right. The lines create a triangular shape with a right-angle in the left corner of the triangle. The base of the triangle is the bottom edge of the image, while the perpendicular side is the left edge. The hypotenuse of the triangle runs smoothly from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the image. Each line is identical in thickness and extends vertically, creating a visually uniform pattern with the lines angling downwards towards the right, forming a linear gradient effect. The spacing between the lines remains constant throughout the image.
