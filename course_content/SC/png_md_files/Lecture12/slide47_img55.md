The image contains two vertical, elongated, cylindrical shapes, both dark gray in color. These cylindrical shapes are positioned parallel to each other with a narrow white vertical gap in between. Each cylinder has a smooth, metallic appearance with gradual highlights and shadows, suggesting a rounded form. The background of the image is solid white, which contrasts with the dark cylinders. Both shapes extend from the top to the bottom edge of the image, giving them a tall, column-like presence. There are no other markings, text, or additional elements visible in the image.
