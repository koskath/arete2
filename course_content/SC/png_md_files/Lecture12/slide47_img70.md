The image consists of a series of vertical bands that stretch from the top to the bottom. The bands are of varying widths and are composed of a gradient of shades ranging from dark gray to black and white. The lightest band is centrally located, a thin vertical strip of bright white. On either side of this white band, there are wider bands of gradual shading starting with dark gray near the center and transitioning to black towards the edges. The contrast between these bands creates a symmetrical pattern. There are no other visible elements, annotations, or structures present in the image.
