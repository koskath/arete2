The image is a vertically-oriented gradient that transitions smoothly from left to right. On the far left, the color begins as a dark black. Moving towards the right, the color gradually becomes lighter, transitioning through various shades of grey. Midway across the image, the gradient reaches a mid-grey color. Continuing towards the right, the grey shades gradually become lighter. Near the far right of the image, the gradient becomes a very light grey, and finally transitions into white at the extreme right edge. The progression is smooth and linear, with no distinct lines or bands separating the different shades. There are no visible shapes, structures, annotations, or other elements within the gradient.
