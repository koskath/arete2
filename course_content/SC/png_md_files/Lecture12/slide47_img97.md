The image consists of vertical bands transitioning smoothly from dark on the left to light on the right. Starting from the left:

1. A thick black band fills the leftmost part of the image, extending vertically.
2. Adjacent to this black band is a dark gray band, lighter than the black but distinctly darker than the next.
3. Following the dark gray band is a medium gray band, which gradually shifts from darker to lighter shades as it moves toward the right.
4. Continuing, the next band is a light gray, which appears lighter than the previous band.
5. A thin band of very light gray follows, leading toward the right edge.
6. The rest of the image is a wide white band extending to the rightmost edge.

The transitions between these bands are smooth and gradual, with no abrupt changes in color. There are no annotations or additional structures present within the image.
