The image consists of two vertical, elongated rectangular strips placed side by side, separated by a small gap. Each strip has a smooth gradient of colors running vertically. The strip on the left predominantly features darker shades with a mix of black and varying tones of gray, transitioning into lighter shades toward the bottom. The strip on the right displays a similar pattern but with slightly more muted colors. Both strips have a somewhat blurred appearance, contributing to a soft, abstract visual effect. The background behind the strips appears as a narrow black border on both the left and right edges.
