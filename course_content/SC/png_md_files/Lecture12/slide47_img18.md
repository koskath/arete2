The image features a series of vertical stripes that are varied in width and color. The colors progress from left to right, beginning with dark blues and transitioning into lighter shades of blue. As the sequence continues, there is a gradual shift towards grays, with some stripes displaying a blend of blue and gray hues. Near the center-right area, a tan or beige stripe appears, adding a break in the color pattern, before returning to darker grays and eventually predominantly dark tones towards the right side of the image. The stripes are consistent in height, running the full vertical extent of the image. There are no visible annotations or text.
