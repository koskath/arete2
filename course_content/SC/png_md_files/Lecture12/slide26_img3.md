The image depicts a bar graph with a time series on the x-axis labeled "Zeit KW" and a percentage scale on the y-axis. The y-axis has markings at 100%, 200%, and 300%, each connected by dashed horizontal lines. The x-axis is labeled with numbers 1 to 8, indicating different time intervals or time units.

Each time unit has a corresponding vertical bar, with varying heights. The bars show a progression where:

- Bar 1 is the shortest and does not reach the 100% line.
- Bars from 2 to 5 increase in height, with Bar 3 reaching slightly beyond the 200% line.
- Bar 4 goes near the 300% line.
- Bar 5 reaches just above the 300% line.
- Bars 6 to 8 progressively decrease in height, with Bar 8 being the shortest and below the 100% line.

There are two annotations in the image:

1. "Angebots-Kapazitätsgrenze durch Wahrscheinlichkeitsbetrachtung (hier 30%)" is written at the level of the 300% line. An arrow pointing to this text indicates it refers to a conceptual limit above which only specific portions of Bars 4 and 5 extend.
2. "Reale Kapazitätsgrenze" is written at the 100% line, suggesting it indicates the actual capacity limit.

All bars are individually delineated with black outlines, some bars have sections shaded differently to differentiate segments within the same bar. The shading creates color differentiation, with some sections of bars darker than others. 

Black arrows indicate both axes, with the one on the y-axis pointing upwards and the one on the x-axis pointing to the right, emphasizing axis directions and the flow of data over the time depicted.
