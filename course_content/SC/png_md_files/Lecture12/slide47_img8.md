The image consists of two adjacent, vertical, elongated shapes with smooth contours resembling blurred, metallic surfaces. The left shape displays a gradient of dark gray transitioning to lighter gray towards the center, with faint streaks running top to bottom. The right shape mirrors this with a similar gradient, slightly lighter in the central region compared to the left. Both shapes have subtle reflections and highlights, suggesting a polished surface. No additional details, annotations, or elements are present. The background is pure white surrounding the shapes on all sides.
