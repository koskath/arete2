The image is a diagram with elements connected by lines and annotated with text. At the top center, there is a photographic image of a desktop computer. To the right of this image, in bold, is the text "Demand: 10 PCs." Below this section, a horizontal line extends and branches into four separate vertical lines, each leading to a shaded rectangular box containing text:

1. The first box on the left reads "17'' Non-interlaced .26 dp monitor." To the left of this box, there is a solid black circle.

2. The second box, central-left, reads "Desktop case." Above this box is a solid black circle.

3. The third box, central-right, reads "1200 MHz FastBus III Motherboard." Above this box is a circle that is half-filled with black, denoting "Only part ATP OK." Below this is an arrow pointing downwards to another box labeled "CPU." To the left of the CPU box, a circle is outlined but not filled in, indicating "ATP negative." Below that, there is text reading "No CPUs available."

4. The fourth box on the right reads "Keyboard, mouse, user guides, and cables." Above this box is a solid black circle.

From the CPU box, a line moves down to another box labeled "Motherboard." To the left of the motherboard box, a circle half-filled with black reads "5 assembled motherboards available."

A line with dots extending from the motherboard box leads further right, indicating a continuation of elements not shown in the image.

At the top left of the diagram, there is a legend with three circular symbols:
- A solid black circle labeled "ATP OK."
- A half-filled circle labeled "Only part ATP OK."
- An outlined circle with no fill labeled "ATP negative."

The entire diagram is enclosed in a rectangular frame. At the bottom center, outside the diagram, is the caption with the text "Figure 3.16: Example for an ATP check."
