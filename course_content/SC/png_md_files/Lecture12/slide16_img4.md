The image displays a bar chart with elements labeled in German. The chart consists of two axes, each marked with an arrow. 

1. **Axes:**
   - The vertical axis is labeled "geglättete Kapazität in h," which translates to "smoothed capacity in hours." An upward-pointing arrow indicates this direction.
   - The horizontal axis is labeled "Zeit KW," meaning "Time in weeks," with an arrow pointing to the right.

2. **Bars:**
   - There are eight vertical bars on the chart, each representing different weeks labeled consecutively from "1" to "8" at the bottom.
   - Each bar consists of a filled lower portion and an additional unfilled or differently colored section above that. The sections' heights vary, showing different amounts each week.

3. **Other Details:**
   - A horizontal dotted line runs across the chart, labeled "100%" near the right end, indicating a threshold or maximum capacity level.
   - The filled portions of the bars differ, making each bar's total height reach the dotted line except the first one, which does slightly exceed it.
   - All bars start from the bottom axis but differ in height based on their filled portions.
   
The composition is primarily monochrome with shades of gray used to differentiate sections within the bars, giving a clear visualization of varying capacities over a period of eight weeks.
