The image is composed of vertical bands that transition across various shades of gray and black. On the left side, there is a band that is predominantly dark black, which gradually transitions into lighter grays moving toward the right. The central area features several bands of medium gray, with subtle variations in tone. Moving further right, the bands become progressively lighter, with the far-right side being the lightest, almost white. There are no visible annotations, structures, or additional elements. The transitions between the different shades are smooth and consistent, creating a gradient-like effect across the width of the image.
