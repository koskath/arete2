The image consists of three vertical bands. The leftmost band is wide and dark gray, occupying a significant portion of the image. Adjacent to this gray band is a narrow vertical strip that is solid black. On the far right side, occupying almost half of the image width, is a solid white area. There are no annotations, text, shapes, or additional features within these bands. The transition between these colors is sharp and without any gradients.
