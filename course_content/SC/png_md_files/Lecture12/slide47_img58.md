The image contains two vertical bands centered horizontally against a white background. Each band is composed of various shades of gray, creating a gradient effect from lighter at the edges to darker towards the center. The left band is slightly wider compared to the right band, and there is a small white gap between them. The gradients in both bands appear smooth, and each band spans the entire vertical length of the image. The surrounding area outside the bands is uniformly white.
