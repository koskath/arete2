The image consists of a series of vertical stripes with varying colors and widths. From left to right:

1. A thin black stripe on the far left.
2. A series of progressively wider stripes that vary in shades of blue, beginning with very dark blue and transitioning to lighter blues.
3. A sequence of greyish-blue stripes, gradually shifting to lighter shades of grey.
4. A noticeable stripe with a light beige or cream color, standing out among the cooler tones.
5. More grey and grey-blue stripes follow, with some appearing darker and some lighter.
6. Towards the right side, the stripes transition to grey, with a mix of darker and medium greys.
7. The far right ends with more narrow grey and black stripes.

The stripes are aligned vertically, have a smooth gradient in color, and change in width throughout the sequence.
