The image consists of a series of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths, spanning the entire frame from left to right. The colors range through various shades, giving it a striped, gradient-like appearance. Starting from the left side, the predominant colors include dark greenish-blacks, transitioning into a lighter green area. Towards the center, there are narrow stripes of very light, almost white hues followed by a series of grey shades. These are interspersed randomly with thin stripes of darker tones.

Moving further to the right, a distinct bright blue stripe stands out, followed by more muted greys and browns. The blue is more saturated compared to surrounding colors. There is also a mixture of very dark browns and additional dark tones towards the right, providing a more complex arrangement of colors. The pattern continues consistently with no additional shapes, annotations, or figures present, maintaining a purely linear and vertical composition throughout the entirety of the image.
