The image features a horizontally oriented infographic with a blue background. At the top, a teal band contains the title in capitalized, bold, white and orange letters: “TEN INVENTORY METRICS YOU NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW.”

On the left side, there are two circular icons with illustrations inside:

1. **Top Left Icon:** Depicts a stack of dollar bills and inventory boxes. To the right, in bold white text, it reads “INVENTORY TURNOVER.”

2. **Middle Left Icon:** Displays a calculator and a pencil. Below it, in bold white text, it says “GROSS MARGIN PERCENT.”

Below these icons, there is a partial view of a third circular icon showing only its top half.

On the right side, there are icon illustrations with bold text:

1. **Top Right Icon:** Shows currency symbols with red and yellow curved arrows on a stack of money. To the left, in bold white text, it says “RETURN ON INVESTMENT.”

2. **Middle Right Icon:** Depicts a box with a red item falling into it. Beside it, in bold white text, it states “ITEM FILL RATE.”

Below these, there is a partial view of a fourth icon showing only its top half.

In the center, there is a large blue shelving unit filled with items. On the top shelf, there are various books and boxes; on the middle shelf, files and storage boxes; and on the bottom shelf, more boxes. In front of the shelves, a person wearing a yellow hard hat is partially visible on the left side. 

The layout presents a balance between text and imagery, with icons and titles corresponding to different metrics, located alongside illustrative elements that enhance the understanding of each metric.
