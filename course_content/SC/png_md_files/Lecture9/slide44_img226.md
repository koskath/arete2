The image consists of multiple vertical lines arranged on a white background. The lines vary in thickness, spacing, and shades of blue, ranging from light to dark. The lines are closely packed in the central area, creating intervals of densely grouped lines. Towards the leftmost and rightmost edges, the density decreases, with isolated lines or pairs appearing against the white backdrop. The lines extend vertically from the top to the bottom of the image, maintaining straightness throughout. No annotations, shapes, or additional structures are visible. The overall appearance presents a pattern of alternating vertical lines, with varying degrees of blue intensity and spacing between them.
