The image displays vertical lines and a slanted horizontal line on a white background. On the left side, there are closely spaced, vertical, dark blue lines of varying thickness. These lines seem to occupy about one-fifth of the image horizontally, starting from the far left. At the upper-middle portion of the image, a light blue horizontal line emerges, moving from the left and extending diagonally towards the lower right portion of the image, gradually thickening as it progresses. The white background is visible in the spaces between the lines and on the remainder of the image.
