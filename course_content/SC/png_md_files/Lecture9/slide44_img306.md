The image contains a vertical composition with a dominant division in color and texture. On the left side, there is a large, solid, uniform area of medium blue color, occupying approximately two-thirds of the image width. This blue section is smooth and consistent in tone. Adjacent to this blue area, on the right side, there is a narrow section featuring alternating vertical lines of white and light gray, creating a striped pattern. These lines are closely spaced and run parallel from the top to the bottom of the image. The rightmost edge of the image has a thin, solid white strip. The overall appearance is one of a smooth blue field transitioning into a textured, striped pattern, further bordered by a slim white margin.
