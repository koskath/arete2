The image consists of a series of vertical lines on a white background. The lines vary in thickness and are primarily blue, with some shading that creates a gradient effect from darker to lighter blue. These lines are unevenly spaced across the image. Some of the lines appear to overlap slightly, creating a layered effect. The entire composition gives an impression of vertical movement or flow from top to bottom. There are no other visible elements, shapes, or annotations present in the image.
