The image consists of vertical bands of color spread horizontally across the entire frame. Starting from the left, the colors transition from light and dark greens to greys and blues, with varying shades and widths. The bands on the left side are generally thinner and more numerous compared to those on the right side. Moving towards the right, the bands increase in width and darker blue tones dominate the right half of the image. The colors are distinct, with sharp, linear separations between them, giving a sense of abstract, barcode-like composition. The overall image displays a gradient-like effect with a concentration of deep blue on the far right.
