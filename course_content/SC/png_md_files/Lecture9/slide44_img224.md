The image contains six elongated vertical shapes against a white background. These shapes are narrow and vary in color and orientation:

1. The first shape on the far left is a thin blue line, nearly vertical.
2. The second shape is slightly thicker and angled to the right. It is blue with a gradient darkening toward the right edge.
3. The third shape is a set of closely spaced, parallel blue lines, vertical in orientation.
4. The fourth shape is similar to the second but slightly thinner and also blue, with a gradual darkening gradient from left to right.
5. The fifth shape is primarily white with a thin black line along its left edge, oriented slightly to the left.
6. The last shape on the far right is very thin, with a faint orange tint on the left and a white tint on the right, tilted slightly to the left.
