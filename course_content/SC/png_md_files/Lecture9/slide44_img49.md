The image consists of a series of vertical stripes arranged horizontally. On the left side of the image, the stripes are narrow and vary in shades of dark blue, black, and gray. These stripes are closely spaced, creating a dense pattern with subtle variations in color intensity. Moving to the right, this pattern continues, but the individual stripes begin transitioning into lighter shades of blue.

Approximately two-thirds across from the left, the colors shift to a uniform and solid bright blue that dominates the entire remaining portion of the image. There are no other visible shapes, annotations, or elements present within the image. The transition from the dense striped pattern to the solid blue is marked and distinct, with no gradient or blending between the two sections.
