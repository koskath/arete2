As the pattern proceeds to the right, the stripes become denser with alternating colors that include dark blue, gray, black, and occasional hints of brown or rusty orange. The overall appearance suggests an abstract and symmetrical design, with each stripe consistently aligned from top to bottom. The background is white, accentuating the vividness and contrast of the vertical stripes.
