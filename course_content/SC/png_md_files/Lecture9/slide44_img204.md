The image is predominantly white with a series of closely packed, vertical lines on the left side. These lines vary in color, composed mostly of shades of blue and light gray, with some lines darker and more pronounced than others. The lines are uniform in height and parallel, extending from the top to the bottom of the image, and they become progressively fainter toward the right side, where they blend into the white background. There are no other visible shapes, structures, or annotations in the image.
