The image contains three main sections. The left section features a large, solid vertical rectangle filled with a consistent shade of blue. Adjacent to the blue section, on the right, there is a narrow vertical space containing alternating, evenly spaced, parallel thin gray lines, which extend vertically from the top to the bottom of the image. The far right side of the image has a small white section, marking the boundary of the image. There are no additional elements, annotations, or structures visible in the image.
