The image consists of multiple vertical lines that vary in color and width, extending from the top to the bottom of the frame. On the left side, there is a narrow vertical band in light gray. To the right of this, there is a slightly thicker band in a gradient of light gray to beige. Continuing to the right, there are bands predominantly in shades of beige, with some incorporating light blue and brown hues. 

Towards the center-right, the lines become more varied and thicker, prominently featuring dark gray, navy blue, royal blue, and black. There are also thin streaks of lighter shades, such as light blue and white, interspersed among the darker colors. The lines vary in thickness, some being very narrow and others broader. The organized pattern of the lines spans the entirety of the image, creating a striped effect without any explicit annotations, labels, or distinguishable patterns besides the color variations.
