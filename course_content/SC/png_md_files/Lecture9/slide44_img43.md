The image displays a series of vertical stripes across its width. On the far left, there are very thin vertical stripes of various shades of blue and black. Moving rightwards, the stripes gradually become thicker and more closely packed with a darker blue dominating among lighter shades and black. As the pattern progresses towards the right side, the dark blue fills almost the entire remaining area, forming a large, solid rectangle of dark blue. At the extreme right edge, there is a very thin vertical stripe of light blue. The background behind the stripes is white, framing the composition. The transition from multiple colors to a single dominant color creates a gradient-like effect across the entire image.
