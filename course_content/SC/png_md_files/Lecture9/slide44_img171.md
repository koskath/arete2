The image contains a close-up of a pencil on a white surface. The pencil is oriented diagonally from the bottom left corner towards the top right corner. The body of the pencil has a wooden texture, with noticeable grain lines running lengthwise along its cylindrical shape. Near the top of the pencil, there is a metallic ferrule that connects the wood to the eraser. The visible part of the eraser is pink. At the bottom edge in the middle, there is a reflected shadow on the white surface, following the pencil's diagonal orientation. The shadow is a grayish tone, closely hugging the contour of the pencil. The background remains entirely white, without any additional elements or text.
