The image consists of a series of vertically-oriented lines and curves on a white background. 

There are several blue, wavy lines running parallel to each other vertically from the top to the bottom of the image. The lines appear to vary slightly in thickness and spacing, creating a pattern of denser clusters and sparser areas. The general movement of the lines seems to involve some curving, resulting in a sinusoidal appearance, especially prominent on the left side of the image.

Towards the right side of the image, there is a visible gap before a single vertical line runs close to the edge of the border. The colors are consistently shades of blue, with no other hues visible.

No other annotations, shapes, or text are present in the image. The overall layout consists predominantly of these repetitive vertical lines against a blank, white background.
