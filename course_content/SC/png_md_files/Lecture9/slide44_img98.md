The image consists of vertically oriented, narrow, striped patterns running from the top to the bottom edge. These stripes vary in color and width. From left to right, the visible colors include:

1. A narrow blue stripe on the far left.
2. A series of adjacent varying shades of green, gray, and khaki, with alternating light and dark tones.
3. Several alternating thin dark and light vertical lines.
4. A wide segment of dark blue that occupies a significant portion of the right side.
5. More thin dark lines appear on the far right, adjacent to the wide blue segment.

These colors blend slightly at the edges where they meet. The entire pattern creates a gradient-like transition effect, with an uneven distribution of colors across the width of the image, having broader and narrower segments interspersed throughout. The background and edges are not visible, suggesting the stripes fill the entire frame.
