The image consists of a rectangular composition featuring a dense array of vertical lines. The left portion is densely packed with lines of various colors, including beige, light green, dark gray, light gray, and shades of blue. These lines are slender and appear closely arranged without uniform spacing. On the right section, there is a smooth gradient transitioning from medium blue on the left to a more intense, darker blue on the right side. The gradient occupies approximately the right half of the rectangle. Overall, the transition from the highly detailed vertical lines to a smoother gradient creates a contrast between complexity and simplicity within the image.
