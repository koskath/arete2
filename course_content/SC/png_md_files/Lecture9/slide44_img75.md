The image consists of a series of vertical bands arranged horizontally. The bands vary in color and pattern, transitioning from left to right. From the leftmost edge to about two-thirds across, multiple narrow bands appear, with colors including light gray, dark gray, black, blue, and dark blue. These bands seem to alternate and vary in width, some being only a few pixels wide while others are wider.

Progressing towards the right, starting about one-third into the image, the colors predominantly shift to darker tones, primarily deep blue with some black bands interspersed. The far right portion of the image is dominated by a broad, uniform band of solid deep blue.

Overall, the image lacks any text, symbols, annotations, or additional graphical elements, maintaining a pattern of colored vertical stripes throughout.
