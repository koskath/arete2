The image consists primarily of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths. The left third of the image is a large off-white stripe with a faint gradient to light gray. To the right of this stripe is a narrow stripe of muted teal. Following this is a broad band in a gradient of gray and beige tones, transitioning smoothly from a darker shade to a lighter one. 

Further right, there is a very narrow, dark gray line separating the previous band from the next series of vibrant blue stripes of different shades. These blue stripes range from a deep, dark blue to a lighter, almost royal blue, interspersed with very dark, thin lines, possibly black or dark navy. 

Towards the far right edge, there are additional narrow bands in muted colors such as brown and deep olive green. The transitions between colors are generally smooth, and each stripe maintains a consistent color throughout its width. There is no text, discernible shapes, or additional annotations visible in this abstract pattern.
