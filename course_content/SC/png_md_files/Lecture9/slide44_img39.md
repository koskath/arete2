The image is filled with vertical bands of varying colors and widths. On the left side, there are thin vertical bands in shades of black, dark blue, light blue, and gray. These bands alternate closely, creating a striped pattern. Moving towards the center and right side of the image, the bands transition into a large, solid area of deep blue color, dominating most of the right half of the image. There is a subtle gradation, with the blue color slightly varying in intensity but predominantly maintaining a rich, uniform blue hue. The transition from the striped pattern to the solid blue is gradual, with the bands thinning out and merging into the larger blue expanse. There are no textual annotations, shapes, or additional structures present. The overall composition is a juxtaposition of the narrow, dark vertical bands against the broad, vivid blue area.
