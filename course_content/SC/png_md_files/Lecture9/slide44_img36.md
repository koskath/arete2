The image consists of vertical stripes with varying widths and shades of blue, black, and gray. On the left side, the stripes are predominantly narrow and are composed of a mix of dark blue, black, and gray. Some stripes have intermediate shades, transitioning between these colors. As the patterns move toward the center of the image, the blue tones become more dominant. The central section primarily contains stripes of a vivid, deep blue color, with some of the stripes being wider than those on the left. Towards the right side of the image, the blue becomes more intense, almost entirely taking over the stripe pattern with bright and solid blue colors. The overall pattern lacks any text or annotations, and the image has a continuous flow from left to right, creating a gradient-like effect from dark mixed tones to a predominantly vivid blue.
