The image contains vertical gradient lines with a concentration densely on the left side. The lines are mostly thin and vary in blue shades, becoming denser and darker as they approach the left edge. Towards the center, the lines are more spaced out and appear lighter. The background is white, and it progressively fades into the gradient lines. On the far right side, the lines are very sparse, blending into the white background. The transition from dense to sparse lines creates a sense of depth and movement across the horizontal axis.
