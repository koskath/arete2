The image consists of a primarily white background with numerous vertical blue lines of varying thicknesses and opacities distributed across the left side of the image. The lines are closely spaced, creating a dense pattern in some areas and more sporadic in others. The right side of the image contains a singular wide blue line that is slightly slanted, adding a tilt effect. On the far right, there are very light, barely visible thin blue lines. The overall design presents a minimalistic composition with an emphasis on vertical linearity and varying line density.
