The image consists of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths. Starting from the left, there is a thin, light blue stripe. Next to it, there are several very thin stripes alternating dark blue and gray tones. These are followed by slightly thicker stripes, featuring darker blues and black hues, with occasional very thin lighter blue lines interspersed. Continuing to the right, the stripes become predominantly a deep blue color, with less frequent variations. The rightmost section of the image is a large, solid block of rich blue, which occupies approximately one-third of the image's total width and extends to the right edge. Throughout the image, the transitions between the stripes are sharp, and there are no discernible patterns beyond the color changes. The colors maintain a uniform vertical orientation across the entire height of the image.
