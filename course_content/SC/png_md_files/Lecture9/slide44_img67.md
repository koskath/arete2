The image consists of several vertical, multicolored stripes arranged side by side. On the left portion, the stripes are narrow and vary in color, including shades of brown, grey, black, and dark blue. Each stripe is distinct, with varying widths and a slight gradient visible within each one. As the composition progresses towards the right, the stripes become wider and eventually transition into a large, solid block of vibrant blue occupying the right half of the image. The blue section is uniform, without any visible texture or variation in color. There are no annotations, symbols, or additional graphical elements present within the image.
