The image consists of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths set against a predominantly white background. On the left side of the image, there is a wide vertical stripe in solid blue. Adjacent to it on the right are numerous thin, closely spaced vertical lines in shades of gray, which create a dense, textured appearance. Further to the right, there is an isolated thin vertical blue line that is slightly thicker than the gray lines, with a noticeable empty white space surrounding it. Farther to the right, there are several wider vertical stripes, primarily in graduated shades of dark teal to blue. These teal-blue stripes are arranged closely together with thin white lines or spaces present between them, giving a striped, alternating pattern towards the right edge of the image.
