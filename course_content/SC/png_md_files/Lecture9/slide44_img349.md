The image contains a vertical arrangement of bold, navy blue stripes on a white background, resembling a barcode. The stripes vary in width. Some are very thin, while others are broader. The spacing between the stripes is inconsistent, with some stripes closely packed together and others having larger gaps between them. The vertical orientation is emphasized by the lengthy extension of the stripes from the top to the bottom of the image space. There are no numbers, letters, or additional markings visible in the image. The edges of the image are bordered by thin white margins on both the left and right sides.
