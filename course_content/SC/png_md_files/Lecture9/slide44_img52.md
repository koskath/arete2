The image consists of a horizontal rectangular band divided into two distinct sections. The left section, occupying approximately one-third of the image, contains a series of vertical stripes. These stripes vary in thickness and are composed of multiple shades of blue, green, black, and gray, creating a gradient-like effect across the section. The colors appear to transition subtly from darker hues on the left to lighter ones towards the center.

The right section, occupying roughly two-thirds of the image, is a solid block of bright blue. There are no discernible patterns or variations in this section; it is uniform in color and texture.

The transition between the striped left section and the solid right section is abrupt and vertically aligned, with no blending between the two. The overall appearance suggests a contrast between complexity and simplicity, with the left side being more intricate and the right side more uniform.
