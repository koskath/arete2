The image consists of a pattern of vertical stripes spanning the entire width. On the left side, the stripes are varied in color, including hues of teal, light blue, dark blue, gray, and black. These stripes are thinner and spaced closely together, creating a dense and intricate appearance. As the pattern progresses towards the right, the stripes gradually increase in width and blend into a solid section of deep blue, covering the entire right portion of the image. This transition from a mixture of narrow stripes to a uniform blue area is smooth and seamless. There are no visible annotations, markings, or spatial structures beyond this pattern of stripes and color transition.
