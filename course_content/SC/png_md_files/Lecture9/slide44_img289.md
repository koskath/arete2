The image consists of vertical, parallel lines and bands of varying colors and thicknesses. On the far left, there is a wide vertical band of solid medium blue. Adjacent to it, moving right, are several closely packed, thin vertical lines in black and white, creating a textured grayscale effect. To the right of these lines, there is a thin, solid blue line followed by a thicker light blue vertical band. Further right, there is another very thin blue line, followed by additional thin black and white lines. The background of the image appears white.
