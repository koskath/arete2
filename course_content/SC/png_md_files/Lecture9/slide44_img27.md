The image consists of a rectangular area with vertical stripes in varying shades of blue. On the left side, the stripes are numerous, narrow, and closely packed, with colors ranging from dark blue, medium blue, to black, and gray. Some stripes are slightly more blurred, while others are more defined. This section makes up approximately one-third of the image's width.

To the right, occupying roughly the remaining two-thirds of the image, is a solid field of a deep, consistent blue color. The transition from the striped section to the solid blue area is abrupt, with a clear boundary.

The entire image has a gradient effect due to the varying shades of blue and the presence of black and gray stripes, giving a sense of depth and texture. There are no visible annotations, text, or additional structures within the image. The edges and top of the image are sharply defined with no additional elements intersecting or overlapping the described features.
