The image consists of a series of vertical stripes spanning horizontally across the entire width. These stripes display a wide array of colors transitioning seamlessly from one to the next. On the left side, the stripes are mostly dark colors, including variations of dark greens, browns, and black. Towards the middle, there is a transition to lighter shades, covering grays, beige, and some soft blues. As the sequence moves to the right, the stripes become predominantly bright and solid blue. After the solid blue area, there is a return to a mix of darker and lighter shades with an emphasis on gray, black, and brown tones. The distribution of the stripes varies slightly in width, with most being relatively thin and there is no visible text or annotations.
