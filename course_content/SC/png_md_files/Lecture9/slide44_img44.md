The image consists of vertical stripes closely aligned, spanning the entire width and height. On the left side, the stripes are thinner and exhibit a variety of dark shades, predominantly blue, with some green and black hues. These thin, varied stripes transition at approximately two-thirds of the image's width into a solid block of a deep, uniform blue, occupying the rightmost portion of the image. The colors are consistently saturated, with the transition from multi-colored stripes to a solid color being sharp and distinct. The overall composition is linear and symmetrical across the vertical axis, with a clear demarcation between the patterned left side and the solid right side.
