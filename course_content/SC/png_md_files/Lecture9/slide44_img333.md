The image displays an arrangement of vertical, parallel stripes on a plain background. There are alternating thick and thin dark blue lines vertically aligned, which appear consistent in their parallel arrangement across the image. The thicker lines are dominant and evenly spaced, while the thinner lines are inserted between them. Each stripe is straight, extending the full length from top to bottom of the visible area. To the far right, there is a singular thin vertical blue line, separate from the grouped stripes on the left side. The background is predominantly white, providing a high contrast to the blue stripes. The alignment and spacing create a regular, rhythmic pattern across the image.
