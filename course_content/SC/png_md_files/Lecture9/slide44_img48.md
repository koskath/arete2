The image is composed of vertical stripes of varying widths and colors. On the left side of the image, there are numerous thin vertical stripes in dark colors, including shades of black, dark gray, and dark blue, all interspersed closely together. As the stripes progress to the right, they gradually increase in width and lighten in color. The right half of the image is dominated by a large, continuous block of a uniform, vivid blue color. There are no additional markings, annotations, shapes, or structures visible beyond these vertical color elements. The entire image is a simple gradient-like transition from multicolored thin stripes to a solid blue area.
