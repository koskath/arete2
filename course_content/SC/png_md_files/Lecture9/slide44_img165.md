A horizontal, abstract composition dominated by vertical lines on the right side. The left side is mostly an off-white color with a thin, vertical, light blue line extending from the top to the bottom edges. To the right, a concentration of vertical lines, closely packed and varying in color and thickness, dominates the scene. These lines include shades such as black, brown, gray, blue, and hints of red, creating a striped pattern. The transition between the off-white section and the striped pattern is abrupt. The lines are evenly distributed but vary in translucence, allowing subtle blending of colors. The overall impression is abstract, with no definitive shapes other than these vertical elements.
