The image consists of two distinct sections, primarily characterized by vertical stripes on a horizontal plane.

1. **Left Section:**
   - Starting from the left edge, there is a series of closely packed, vertical blue stripes. The shades vary from light to dark blue.
   - The stripes have a gradient effect with colors blending smoothly from one into another.
   - The concentration of stripes in this section is higher compared to the right.

2. **Right Section:**
   - This section features more widely spaced vertical stripes.
   - Dark blue and black stripes are interspersed with white spaces, creating a clear contrast.
   - The rightmost stripes are fewer and occupy a smaller horizontal space compared to the left section.

The overall structure appears abstract, without any recognizable patterns or symbols beyond vertical linear forms. The image lacks any text, annotations, or additional shapes.
