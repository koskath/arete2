The image consists of two distinct sections with vertical stripes:

1. On the left side, approximately occupying the left two-thirds of the image, there are multiple vertical blue stripes of varying shades. These stripes range from dark blue to light blue, with some appearing as gradients transitioning from one shade to another. The stripes are closely aligned and vary slightly in thickness but maintain a consistent pattern of blues across the section.

2. The right section of the image features a series of narrower vertical stripes, alternating between blue and white. These stripes are uniformly aligned, alternating regularly, and appear to be approximately one-third of the total image width. The white stripes are stark, while the blue stripes match those of the left section in shade, giving a cohesive visual appearance to the overall image.

There is a stark contrast between the sections, with the left side offering a dense variation of blue hues and the right presenting a more defined, alternating pattern of blue and white stripes. The entire background is white, emphasizing the colored stripes.
