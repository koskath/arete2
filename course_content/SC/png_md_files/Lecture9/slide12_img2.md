The image consists of four quadrants, each illustrating a different supply chain concept with labels and diagrams.

**Top Left Quadrant: "Creating bulk"**
- Title: "Creating bulk" located at the top.
- Diagram: 
  - Three identical delivery trucks on the left, each facing right, with arrows pointing towards a building.
  - A single larger truck on the right, also facing right, indicating movement away from the building.
  - The building is centrally located, depicted as a simple rectangular shape with a trapezoidal roof.

**Top Right Quadrant: "Breaking bulk"**
- Title: "Breaking bulk" at the top.
- Diagram:
  - A single large truck on the left, facing right, with an arrow pointing towards a building.
  - Three identical smaller delivery trucks on the right side of the building, each facing right, with arrows moving away from the building.
  - The building, centrally positioned, is drawn similarly to the previous quadrant.

**Bottom Left Quadrant: "Combining goods"**
- Title: "Combining goods" located at the top.
- Diagram:
  - Separated components of a bicycle on the left: a handlebar, bicycle frame, and a pair of wheels with arrows pointing towards the building.
  - A complete bicycle on the right with an arrow pointing right, indicating movement away.
  - A central building, visually consistent with previous quadrants.

**Bottom Right Quadrant: "Smoothing"**
- Title: "Smoothing" at the top.
- Diagram:
  - A stopwatch icon on the top left and top right.
  - An industrial building with smokestacks on the left with an arrow pointing toward the central building.
  - A generic multi-story building on the right, with an arrow moving away from the central building.
  - The central building in the same style as earlier quadrants.

Each quadrant visually signifies different processes in logistics or supply chain management using arrows, buildings, vehicles, and goods.
