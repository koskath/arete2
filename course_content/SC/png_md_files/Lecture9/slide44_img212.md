The image consists of multiple vertical, parallel lines with varying thicknesses and shades of blue against a white background. These lines exhibit slight waviness, causing them to lean slightly to the right. The lines are closely spaced and present a gradient effect, with a mixture of lighter and darker blue hues. There are a total of twelve discernible lines, with the spacing between them mostly consistent, save for a slightly wider gap between two pairs of the lines. The overall appearance is that of a repetitive pattern running across the image vertically.
