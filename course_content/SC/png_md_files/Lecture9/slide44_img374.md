- Adjacent to this stripe, there is a thicker and more prominent vertical band that is predominantly dark blue.
- This central dark blue band contains numerous very thin vertical lines within it, which vary in shades of blue ranging from dark to light, creating a striped effect. 
- To the right of this central band, there is an area of white that occupies a significant portion of the right side of the image, distinctly separating itself from the blue sections on the left.
- Near the far right edge, there is a very thin vertical line, which appears to have shades of blue similar to the left-most part of the image.
