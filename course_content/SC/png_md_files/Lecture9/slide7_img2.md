The image depicts a flowchart representing a supply chain structure. The chart is organized into hexagonal and rectangular shapes, each labeled with text, connected by arrows indicating flow direction.

1. **Top Row (Hexagons)**:
   - Four hexagons, each aligned horizontally, representing different manufacturing or packaging locations.
   - From left to right:
     - Hexagon labeled "Manufacturing Denmark."
     - Hexagon labeled "Manufacturing Switzerland."
     - Hexagon labeled "Packaging Czech Rep."
     - Hexagon labeled "Outsourced Mfg EU/Asia."

2. **Connections from Top Row**:
   - Black arrows extend downward from each hexagon.
   - Arrows from "Manufacturing Denmark" and "Manufacturing Switzerland" merge into a single line leading to the next level.
   - Arrows from "Packaging Czech Rep." and "Outsourced Mfg EU/Asia" each independently connect downward to different blocks in the lower level.

3. **Middle Row (Rectangles)**:
   - Two dark gray rectangles positioned side by side, labeled as central distribution centers.
   - From left to right:
     - Rectangle labeled "Central DC Denmark."
     - Rectangle labeled "Central DC Switzerland."

4. **Transitions from Middle Row**:
   - Downward arrows from both rectangles point to two rectangles on the lower level.
   - An arrow extends from "Central DC Denmark" to both "Central Warehouse Germany" (white rectangle) and "Assortment Pack Assembly Denmark" (gray rectangle).
   - An arrow from "Central DC Switzerland" also points to "Assortment Pack Assembly Denmark."

5. **Bottom Row (Rectangles)**:
   - Two rectangles positioned side by side:
     - Rectangle on the left in white labeled "Central Warehouse Germany."
     - Rectangle on the right in gray labeled "Assortment Pack Assembly Denmark."

6. **Annotations**:
   - On the left-hand side, alongside the respective rows:
     - Label "Central DC Level 1" next to the middle row.
     - Label "Central W/H Level 2" next to the bottom row.

The flowchart visually represents the paths from manufacturing and packaging sources through central distribution centers down to final warehouse and assembly locations, indicating a hierarchical supply chain process.
