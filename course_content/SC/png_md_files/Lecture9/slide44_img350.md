The image depicts a vertical series of black and white stripes resembling a barcode. The stripes are of varying widths, stretching from top to bottom within the frame. The white stripes are generally narrower than the black ones. There is a slight curvature to the right in the central portion of the barcode, with the stripes appearing more distorted towards this area. The barcode extends horizontally across the midsection between two thin white borders on the left and right. The upper and lower edges of the image do not contain any additional elements aside from the continuation of the barcode lines.
