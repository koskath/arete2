The image consists of two distinct sections vertically divided. On the left side, there are numerous vertical stripes varying in thickness and color. These stripes are arranged closely together, creating a densely packed pattern. The colors of the stripes include multiple shades of blue, gray, and black, with some lighter and darker tones interspersed throughout.

On the right side of the image, there is a solid, uniform area of deep blue color that takes up about half of the image's width. This section is smooth and evenly colored, with no visible patterns or interruptions.

The transition between these two sections is abrupt; the striped pattern ends sharply where the solid blue begins. There are no additional annotations, labels, or visible structures in the image.
