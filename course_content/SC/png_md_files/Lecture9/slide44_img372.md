The image consists of a series of vertical stripes that vary in color and width. From left to right:

1. On the far left, there is a thin, vertical stripe of medium blue.
2. Next to it is a broader stripe featuring a gradation from dark blue on the left edge to a lighter blue on the right edge.
3. Following this, there is a narrow band of very dark blue.
4. After that, there is a wide stripe of vibrant royal blue.
5. Adjacent to this is a series of very thin vertical lines grouped closely together, alternating in shades of dark blue, cobalt, and a few lines with lighter tints.
6. To the right of these lines is a very thick column, predominantly in a solid deep blue with minimal variation.
7. On the far right edge, there is a very thin vertical line in a dark blue that almost merges with the background.

The transition between different shades of blue is smooth, and the arrangement creates a predominantly blue-toned abstract pattern across the image. The background surrounding these stripes is white.
