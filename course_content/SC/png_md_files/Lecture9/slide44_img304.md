The image consists of two distinct sections. On the left side, there is a large blue area that takes up about two-thirds of the image vertically. It is a solid blue color with smooth edges. The right side of the image features a dense cluster of vertical gray and white lines. These lines vary slightly in thickness and are closely spaced together, creating an effect resembling a gray and white striped pattern. The lines reach from the top to the bottom of the image and occupy about one-third of the image horizontally. There are no other visible elements, annotations, or structures in the image.
