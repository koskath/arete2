The image features a digitally manipulated pattern resembling a barcode. On the left side, there is a gradient of various shades of blue, starting from the left edge with a lighter blue and gradually deepening to a darker blue towards the center. This blue region is slightly curved towards the right. 

To the right of this gradient, there is an abrupt transition to a mostly white section, occupying about half of the width of the image. 

On the far right of the image, there are vertical black and blue lines of varying thickness, organized parallel and closely spaced. These lines create a barcode-like appearance, with alternating spaces that are mostly white. The blue used in the lines is similar to the shades found on the left side's gradient. The overall image has a linear, horizontal orientation.
