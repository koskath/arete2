The image contains a sequence of vertical lines that extend from the top to the bottom against a white background. These lines are closely spaced and vary slightly in thickness and shading, ranging from light to dark blue hues. The lines appear parallel to each other with varying intensity, creating a striped pattern. The design fills the left portion of the image, tapering off irregularly towards the right, where fewer lines are visible, leaving more of the white background exposed as the spacing increases.
