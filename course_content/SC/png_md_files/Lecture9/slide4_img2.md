The image consists of a series of interconnected rectangular boxes with text inside, linked by arrows indicating directional flow. 

On the left side, there are three stacked rectangles labeled "Supplier." The top "Supplier" has a vertical arrow pointing downward to the second "Supplier." The second "Supplier" has a horizontal arrow pointing right to a third, larger "Supplier" box below it, with another vertical arrow pointing from it downward to the next stage in the flow.

Moving to the right, connected by horizontal arrows, there are a series of boxes:

1. A rectangular box labeled "Global Consolidation."
2. A rectangular box labeled "Regional Distribution."
3. A rectangular box labeled "National Distribution."
4. A rectangular box labeled "Retailer Distribution." An upward arrow leads from this box to a larger box above labeled "Retailer Distribution Centre."

From the "Retailer Distribution Centre" box, there are multiple arrows pointing outward:

- An upward vertical arrow connects to a smaller box labeled "Retailer."
- To the right, there are three horizontal arrows extending from the "Retailer Distribution Centre" box, each pointing to a smaller "Retailer" box. The first "Retailer" box has two stacked smaller "Retailer" boxes to the right, connected by short horizontal arrows.
- Below, the same arrangement is mirrored with another horizontal arrow leading to a "Retailer" box, also with two stacked "Retailer" boxes to the right connected similarly. 

This structure forms a branching network, illustrating the flow from suppliers through various distribution stages to retailers.
