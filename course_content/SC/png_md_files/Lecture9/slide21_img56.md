The image consists of a series of parallel horizontal bands extending across the entire width. The bands are continuous and uniform in color with slight variations, primarily in shades of dark green, gray, and cream. There are approximately 22 distinct bands, with the darker green and gray bands slightly thicker than the lighter cream bands. The bands appear to be coalesced without any gaps between them, creating a striped pattern. There are no additional elements, annotations, or variations in texture throughout the image.
