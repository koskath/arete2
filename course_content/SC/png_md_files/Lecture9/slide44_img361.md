The image consists of a barcode pattern and a blue gradient region. On the right side, there is a series of alternating black and white vertical stripes of varying thicknesses, forming a barcode pattern. The stripes extend from the top to the bottom of the image. On the left side, there is a solid blue column with a gradient effect, starting darker blue at the bottom and fading towards the top. The overall layout shows the blue gradient region occupying the left third, while the barcode pattern is on the right two-thirds. The background is white, which accentuates both the blue and the barcode pattern.
