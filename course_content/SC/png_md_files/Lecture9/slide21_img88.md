The image consists of a horizontal, narrow strip featuring a series of parallel, wavy gray lines extending across the frame. The lines vary slightly in thickness, with some appearing bolder and others more intricate. Above these lines is a small section of a light gray area which appears as a blurred background or surface. Below the wavy lines is a solid black space, which takes up the majority of the lower portion of the image. There are no visible annotations, shapes, or additional elements present in the image. The overall composition is simple, with a focus on the contrast between the gray wavy lines and the black background.
