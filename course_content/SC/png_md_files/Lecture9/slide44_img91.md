The image consists of vertical stripes of varying widths that span the entire height of the image. Starting from the left, there is a thin vertical stripe in dark green, followed by a slightly wider stripe in olive green. Adjacent to this is a narrow black stripe, then a thin dark gray stripe, followed by a wider stripe in light gray. Next, there is a sequence of narrow stripes in dark gray, dark blue, and a lighter blue, gradually transitioning into wider and more intense blue shades. The right half of the image predominantly features a wide bright blue stripe that occupies a significant portion, flanked by a thin darker blue stripe on each side. The colors blend into each other with smooth transitions, creating a gradient effect, particularly in the central and rightmost blue sections.
