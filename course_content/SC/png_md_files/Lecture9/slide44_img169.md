The image is dominated by a series of vertical lines on the right side. These lines are closely packed, varying in color and thickness, creating a pattern of stripes. The colors present in these lines range from shades of brown, tan, and beige to darker tones of black and gray. The left side of the image is entirely white, providing a stark contrast to the striped pattern on the right. The transition between the white space and the patterned area is sharp and linear, indicating a distinct separation between the two sections. No other visible elements, structures, annotations, or spatial relationships are present in the image.
