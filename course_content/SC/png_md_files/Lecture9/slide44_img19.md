The image consists of a series of vertical stripes spanning the entire width. On the left side, there is a dense cluster of thin vertical stripes with varying shades of blue, black, brown, and gray. These stripes are closely packed and vary in width and color intensity. As the visual progresses towards the right, the stripes transition into broader bands, displaying darker shades of blue. The image culminates on the right side with a large, solid section of a deep blue color that occupies about one-third of the image. The transition from left to right is smooth, with the balance gradually shifting from a mix of diverse, narrow stripes to broader, more homogeneous blue regions.
