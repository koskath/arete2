The image consists of vertical stripes, each running from top to bottom. On the left side, the stripes include a range of muted and darker colors, such as various shades of gray, olive green, and black. As we move to the right, the stripes shift gradually towards darker shades of blue. The transition from the left side to the right is smooth, with the colors blending subtly into each other. On the far right, the stripes are distinctly a vibrant solid blue. The overall composition is abstract, without any distinct shapes or annotations, and the lines maintain a consistent width throughout.
