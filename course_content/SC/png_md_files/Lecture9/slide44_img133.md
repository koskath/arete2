The image consists of a pattern of vertical stripes that run continuously from left to right. These stripes are of varying widths, colors, and shades. The colors range from dark tones like black and dark brown to lighter shades, including whites, greys, and blues. There are prominent segments of pure blue and lighter blue, along with several shades of grey and brown interspersed. The sequence of colors appears to be random, with no repetitive or predictable pattern. The stripes are tightly packed against each other, creating a contiguous sequence across the image.
