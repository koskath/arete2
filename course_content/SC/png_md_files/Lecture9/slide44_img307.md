The image consists of two main sections. On the left side, there is a large solid area of blue. This blue section dominates the left portion of the image. On the right side, there are several vertical streaks that appear grayish in color. These streaks vary slightly in intensity and thickness but are mostly consistent, giving an impression of lines or blurred columns against a mostly white background that comprises the rest of the image apart from the blue area. The transition between the two sections is abrupt, with a clear division between the blue and the area containing the grayish streaks. The overall layout is simple, with no additional elements such as annotations, shapes, or details present.
