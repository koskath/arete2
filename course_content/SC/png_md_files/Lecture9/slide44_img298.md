The image consists of four vertical sections. On the left side, there is a wide blue stripe occupying about half the image. Next to it, there is a narrow white stripe that runs parallel to the blue one. Adjacent to the white stripe is a series of closely spaced, thin, vertical gray lines, which take up the next segment of the image. These gray lines are uniform and evenly spaced. On the right, there is another narrow white stripe. The far-right edge features a very thin blue line, consistent in color with the wide blue section on the left.
