The image consists of multiple vertical lines of varying thickness and opacity, displayed on a white background. These lines are predominantly blue, interspersed with lighter blue and pale gray tones. They run parallel to each other and span the length of the image. The width of the lines varies, with some being thin and closely spaced, while others are thicker with more space between them. The lines are evenly distributed across the image, creating a pattern that covers the entire canvas from left to right. There are no annotations, labels, or additional shapes present in the image.
