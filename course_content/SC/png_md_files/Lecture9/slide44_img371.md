Moving towards the center, the blue becomes progressively darker in broader stripes. The center of the image features a wide area of deep, dark blue with subtle variations in tone. Beyond the central dark blue, the bands continue to narrow, displaying a mix of medium to dark blue shades. As the image progresses towards the right, the stripes become narrower and more distinctly separated, with the darkest blue on the far right. The top and bottom edges of the image are straight and clean, maintaining a consistent focus on the vertical alignment of colors. The overall appearance is one of a gradient transition in blues, with the most profound darkness concentrated at the center transitioning back into narrower lighter blues at the ends. The background is white, providing contrast and emphasizing the vertical bands of color.
