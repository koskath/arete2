1. A very narrow blue stripe on the far left.
2. A wider stripe with a dark, almost black color slightly leaning towards green.
3. A thin stripe of dark olive green.
4. A wider stripe with a gradient of grayish green.
5. Many alternating thin stripes of greenish grays and light grays.
6. A wider stripe with a whitish cream color.
7. A thin stripe of dark gray.
8. A slightly paler gray stripe.
9. A broader stripe with a light gray color.
10. A very narrow black stripe.
11. A thick stripe of bright blue.
12. Several alternating stripes of dark brown and variations of gray and blue.
13. A dark, almost black stripe near the far right.
14. A medium brown stripe with a slight reddish tint.

Each stripe is uniform in color without any visible texture or pattern other than solid vertical bands. The arrangement of colors appears to transition from darker shades on the left, through several lighter shades towards the middle, and back to darker shades on the right.
