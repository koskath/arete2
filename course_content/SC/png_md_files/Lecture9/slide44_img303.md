The image consists of two distinct vertical sections. On the left, there is a wide, solid blue area taking up approximately half the width of the image. On the right side of the image, there is a series of closely spaced vertical white and gray lines creating a striped pattern. There is also a thin blue line along the right edge. The two sections are separated by a clear boundary, with the blue section on the left and the striped section on the right.
