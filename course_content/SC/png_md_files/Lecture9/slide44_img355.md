The image shows a barcode composed of alternating vertical stripes of varying widths and colors. The main area consists of dark blue and white stripes. The dark blue stripes are of different thicknesses, creating the typical pattern found in barcodes. The white stripes separate these blue lines. On the left side of the image, there is a thick vertical blue band that is gradient, transitioning from a deep blue to a lighter blue from left to right. The barcode stripes occupy most of the center and right part of the image, with the gradient blue band just barely visible along the left edge. The overall arrangement is horizontal, with no visible numbers or text associated with the barcode.
