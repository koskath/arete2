The image consists of a series of vertical, colored stripes spanning across the frame. The stripes vary in width and color, creating a pattern of alternating hues. 

From left to right, the visible colors include:
1. A very thin, light blue stripe on the far left edge.
2. A sequence of wider, earthy tones including dark gray, olive green, and brownish gray.
3. A narrow dark gray stripe followed by a wider one.
4. Several thin, closely packed stripes of varying shades including tan and dark gray.
5. A noticeable wider stripe in light gray, adjacent to a slightly darker gray.
6. Progressively wider stripes in varying shades of blue, from a medium dark blue to a vibrant royal blue.
7. A transition to deeper blues and dark gray, with a very dark stripe towards the right.
8. A very thin light gray stripe near the right edge.
9. There is a repetition of a thin, light blue stripe on the extreme right edge.

The overall composition is linear, with no interruptions, and the stripes are parallel, running vertically from top to bottom.
