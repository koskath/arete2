The image is composed of vertical stripes of varying widths and colors. Starting from the left:

1. On the far left, there is a very thin vertical stripe of light blue.
2. Adjacent to it is a thicker white stripe.
3. Following that is a sequence of alternating, very thin stripes in shades of gray, brown, and a touch of yellow-green.
4. The central portion features numerous thin stripes with a predominance of dark colors, including dark blue, gray, black, and hints of brown, arranged closely together. These create a densely packed area with a mix of neutral to dark tones.
5. Moving toward the right, there is a dominant broad stripe of solid bright blue, occupying about one-third of the image width, extending vertically from top to bottom.
6. The far right edge concludes with another very thin stripe of light blue, slightly lighter than the leftmost blue stripe.

Overall, the image transitions from a mix of light and dark thin stripes on the left to a single, large blue block on the right.
