The image consists of a series of vertical colored lines spanning from the top to the bottom. The left side begins with very thin strips of blue and dark blue, transitioning into wider bands of various shades of blue and black. As it moves to the right, the colors blend and overlap, forming a kind of gradient that becomes progressively more uniform, dominated by different shades of blue, with a solid deep blue occupying a significant portion towards the right. The rightmost edge is mostly blue, with the colors tapering off into white space at the boundary. There are no distinct shapes, annotations, or spatial divisions visible; it is purely a sequence of colored vertical bands.
