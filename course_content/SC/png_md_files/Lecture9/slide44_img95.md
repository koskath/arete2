The image consists of a series of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths that create a gradient effect. Starting from the left, a bright blue stripe is followed by several narrow stripes in shades of green, gray, and dark blue. The central part of the image features a wider section consisting of light gray, silver, and muted blue tones. There is a prominent deep blue stripe about two-thirds from the left, next to various shades of gray and black. Towards the right, the colors transition into darker hues, including a few dark brown or black stripes. The entire composition is framed by two thin blue vertical lines along the far left and right edges. The overall pattern is abstract and lacks any text, diagrams, or annotations.
