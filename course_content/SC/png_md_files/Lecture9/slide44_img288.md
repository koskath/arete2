The image is a narrow, fragmented section containing several vertical columns on a white background. From left to right:

1. A large, solid blue column occupies the leftmost part of the image, covering about one-quarter of the width.
2. Adjacent to the blue column, there is a series of thin, vertical, gray lines spaced closely together. These lines cover a narrow width and extend parallel to one another.
3. There is a white space dividing the gray lines from the next element.
4. Next, a narrow blue line appears, slightly to the right of center in the image.
5. This is followed by another elongated, thicker shape that appears greenish-blue, slightly tilted to the right. It is narrower than the first blue column.
6. The rest of the image on the far right is mostly white space. 

There are no visible annotations, text, or labels.
