The image consists of a series of vertically oriented, colored stripes against a white background. On the left side, there is a wide vertical blue stripe. Adjacent to it is a section of thin, closely spaced vertical gray lines. Further right is a thin blue line, which is slightly slanted and separates the gray section from another area of vertical lines. This area consists of alternating medium and dark blue lines, parallel and tightly spaced. The stripes have various thicknesses, but all maintain a vertical orientation. The overall arrangement is linear and symmetrical from left to right.
