The image consists of a composition divided into two main sections. The left section, occupying approximately three-quarters of the image, is filled with a solid medium blue color. The edge of this blue section meets a white space on the right. The dividing line between the blue and white areas is smooth and slightly curved, about one-fourth from the right edge of the image. In the top right corner, outside the blue area, part of the margin is shaded in light gray, adding a gentle gradient to the otherwise white section. There are no additional shapes, annotations, or text present in the image.
