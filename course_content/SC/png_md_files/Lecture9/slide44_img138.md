The image consists of a series of vertical stripes of varying widths stretched across the frame. The leftmost stripe is dark green, followed by a column of light green. Next, there is a medium-width stripe of darker forest green. Adjacent to this is a wide band of lighter green with some white running through it. 

Towards the center, a broad white column with soft green tinting is visible. To its right, a narrow dark fill of dark gray or brown appears. Beyond that, a wider stripe of muted beige emerges, followed by a large, distinct stripe of bright blue. 

Continuing right, there is a narrow dark brown band, succeeded by a stripe displaying various shades of brown and blue. Another broad band, grayish mixed with brown appears, followed by another narrow strip of dark blue near the far right edge of the image. Flanking the composition on both sides are thin dark blue lines, demarcating the boundary of the image.
