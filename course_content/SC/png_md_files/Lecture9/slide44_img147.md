The image consists of vertical stripes of varying colors, each with different widths. The colors present include soft blue, light brown, muted green, dark gray, bright blue, and taupe. These stripes form a continuous pattern with no defined edges or breaks. The leftmost stripe is thin and light blue, leading into a thicker band of mixed gray and beige tones. There is a prominent bright blue stripe in the middle-right section of the image, adding a vibrant contrast to the otherwise muted palette. The stripes occupy the entire space of the image, creating a symmetrical arrangement of vertical lines from the left to the right edge.
