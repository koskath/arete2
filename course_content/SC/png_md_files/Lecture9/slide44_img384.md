The image consists of a series of vertical stripes of varying widths running across the entire width of the frame. The stripes exhibit a gradual color transition from left to right. On the left side, the colors begin with lighter shades of blue and progressively shift towards darker shades of blue. This gradient intensifies towards the center, leading to a section dominated by dark navy blue hues, which continue towards the right. The stripes are closely spaced, with some thinner than others, creating a dense pattern. The background appears to have no texture or additional elements, with the entire focus on the vertical gradient stripes. The overall visual effect is a smooth transition from lighter blues on the left to deeper blues on the right.
