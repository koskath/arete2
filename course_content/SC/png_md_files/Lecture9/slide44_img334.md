The image contains a series of vertical, parallel lines arranged closely on the left side. These lines vary in width; some are thicker while others are thinner, and they are dark blue. The right side of the image has a single, wider blue line with a gradient that shifts from dark blue at the top to a lighter blue towards the bottom. Between these two groups of lines, there is a white space that separates them. The background of the image is entirely white.
