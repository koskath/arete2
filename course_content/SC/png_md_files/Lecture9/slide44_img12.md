The image consists of a horizontal composition featuring vertical lines. The left side of the image contains a series of closely packed, thin vertical stripes. These stripes vary in color, alternating between different shades of blue, gray, purple, and black. The colors are intermingled, with no discernible pattern, creating a gradient effect. The right side of the image features a solid area of deep cobalt blue, occupying approximately half of the image's width. The transition from the striped section to the solid blue area is abrupt, with a clear dividing line. The overall appearance suggests a contrast between the detailed complexity of the left side and the uniform simplicity of the right side. The top and bottom edges of the image appear to have thin white borders framing the composition.
