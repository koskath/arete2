The image features a series of vertical lines of varying thicknesses and shades of blue on a white background. The lines are concentrated on the left side of the image, becoming denser as they approach the center. Thicker lines are interspersed with thinner ones, with some lines being solid and others slightly faded. The right side of the image is mostly white, with the lines gradually thinning out and almost disappearing into the background as they extend to the far right. The overall pattern creates a sense of progression from dense to sparse as one moves from left to right.
