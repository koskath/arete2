The image consists of several vertical stripes of varying colors, widths, and degrees of transparency against a white background. 

- On the far left, there is a wide vertical stripe colored in solid blue.
- Next to the blue stripe, towards the right, there is a section made up of multiple very thin vertical lines closely spaced together. These lines are light gray and evenly aligned, creating a striped pattern.
- Adjacent to this gray-striped section is a broader stripe that fades from a light blue at the top into a slightly darker blue towards the bottom.
- To the right of the fading blue stripe is another arrangement of multiple thin vertical lines, darker and denser than the previous gray lines, exhibiting a dark teal hue. These lines vary slightly in thickness and are more concentrated.
- Finally, an additional solid color stripe mirrors the first blue stripe, situated towards the right end of the image, in a dark teal color.

There are no labels, annotations, or additional elements present in the image, and all elements are strictly vertical.
