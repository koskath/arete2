The image consists of a white background featuring four distinct blue lines. 

1. The first blue line is placed towards the left side of the image. It is vertical, straight, and evenly colored.
2. The second line is located more centrally but slightly towards the left. This line is diagonal, slanting from the bottom left to the top right with a uniform blue hue.
3. The third line is found slightly to the right of the center. This line is similar in color, uniformly blue, and follows a diagonal path from the top left towards the bottom right.
4. The fourth line is towards the right edge of the image. It consists of closely spaced vertical stripes, alternating between blue and white, forming a pattern that stretches from the top to the bottom of the image.

All four lines are distinct in placement and orientation across the white background.
