The image consists of vertical stripes of varying widths and colors, spanning the entire frame from top to bottom. The sequence of colors from left to right is as follows:

1. A dark stripe with shades of black and dark green on the far-left edge.
2. Multiple thin stripes in varying shades of grayish-green.
3. A broader dark section combining various dark green and black hues.
4. Thin lines transitioning from dark to slightly lighter shades of green and gray.
5. Several moderately wider stripes in pale gray, light green, and light beige tones.
6. A broad section in mid-gray.
7. A deep, vivid blue stripe, the widest among the elements, located towards the right of the center.
8. After the blue, a thicker gray stripe.
9. Several smaller stripes in gradations of light gray and beige.
10. Towards the right of the image, a series of thin dark stripes with maroon and greenish tones interspersed with the pattern.
11. Another wide section in mixed gray-green with hints of blue.
12. More thin stripes, predominantly dark with varying off-greens.
13. The far-right edge finishes with lighter gray and blueish hues.

Each stripe runs vertically, maintaining consistent color along its length. The overall pattern gives the appearance of a barcode or a digital abstract artwork.
