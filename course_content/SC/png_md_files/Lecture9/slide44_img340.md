The image contains a pattern of vertical lines resembling a barcode on the left side. These lines consist of alternating thick and thin dark blue stripes on a white background. Each stripe is parallel to the others, aligned vertically from top to bottom. To the right side of the image, there is a single, slightly curved thick blue line that is more angled and is separated by a white gap from the rest of the vertical lines. The background is entirely white, and there are no additional elements, annotations, or textures present within the image.
