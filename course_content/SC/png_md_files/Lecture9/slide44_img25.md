The image consists of vertical stripes filling the entire frame. The leftmost section, approximately one-fourth of the image's width, features tightly packed vertical stripes of varying widths. These stripes display assorted shades of blue, gray, and black. As these stripes progress to the right, they gradually compress until they merge into a singular, uniform band of deep blue. The deep blue occupies the remaining three-fourths of the image's width, stretching continuously to the right edge. There are no annotations, text, or additional elements visible within this image, resulting in a seamless transition from a multi-colored stripe pattern to a solid blue color.
