The image displays a series of vertical lines and streaks with varying shades of dark green and gray. The lines are closely packed together, and some appear slightly blurred with irregular spacing. The darker streaks have a gradient effect, creating a sense of depth and texture. Amidst the vertical streaks, there are a few subtle horizontal light gray lines that intersect them, contributing further to the texture. Additionally, the lower right corner has a significantly darker area without distinct lines, adding contrast to the rest of the image's pattern. The overall composition is abstract, with the variations in shades and line thicknesses suggesting an organic or fluid quality.
