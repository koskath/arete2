The image consists of a series of vertical lines and bands in varying colors and widths stretched across a horizontal format. The left third features a concentration of narrow, closely spaced lines in various shades. The colors range from deep blue, light blue, dark gray, brownish-yellow, light gray, to greenish-gray, with some lines more pronounced than others. Toward the center and right, the image transitions into a more uniform band of vibrant blue, dominating the remaining space. The lines blend seamlessly, creating a gradient effect from the complex variety on the left to the solid blue on the right. The lines appear parallel and consistently vertical throughout the image. There are no annotations or labels present.
