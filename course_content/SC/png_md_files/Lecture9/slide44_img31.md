The image consists of vertical stripes that vary in width and color. On the left side, there are numerous narrow, multicolored stripes featuring a range of shades including dark blues, grays, and hints of lighter colors. These stripes transition gradually into one another, creating a textured appearance. Towards the center-right, the stripes become fewer and merge into a solid, rich blue area that dominates the right half of the image. The solid blue area is uniform in color and extends to the far right edge of the image. There are no visible annotations, shapes, or other markings within the image.
