The image consists of a series of vertical lines in varying shades of blue, running from the top to the bottom of the image. These lines are distributed unevenly across the canvas. On the left side, there are thin lines, spaced irregularly, with both light and dark blue hues. As the lines move towards the right, they become more closely spaced, showing a gradient of blue tones, ranging from light to dark. The far right side of the image shows lines merging into a thicker, solid blue band that slightly curves towards the bottom right corner. The background is a uniform white throughout, allowing the blue lines to stand out prominently against it. There are no annotations, text, or additional shapes visible in the image.
