The image consists of a dense pattern of vertical stripes with varying shades of blue and white. The stripes are tightly packed together, creating a repetitive pattern across most of the image. The width of the stripes alternates irregularly, with some being thick and others thin. The colors transition subtly between different blue hues, ranging from dark navy to lighter sky blues, interspersed with white. The pattern occupies the left portion of the image, while the right side is predominantly white, with only a minimal, thin blue line visible along the right edge. The overall arrangement is linear and parallel, forming an aesthetic of structured repetition.
