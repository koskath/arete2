The image consists of vertical streaks and bands of varying shades of gray and green. The streaks range from very light, almost white, to dark green, creating a blurred effect across the image. The pattern is linear, with the bands running parallel from the top to the bottom of the frame. The texture appears smooth due to the blurred nature of the image, with no distinct shapes or forms other than the vertical lines. The overall appearance is of an abstract, gradient pattern, with no specific details or annotations visible.
