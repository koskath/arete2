The image consists of a large blue area occupying approximately the left three-quarters of the image, with a slight diagonal wave-like edge on the right side of this blue section. Adjacent to this is a narrow vertical area that appears white at the very edge on the right. Between the blue and white sections, there is a series of closely spaced, thin, horizontal gray lines. These lines are parallel and run vertically down the central part of the image, creating a gradient or shading effect. The transition between the blue area and the white area with gray lines is smooth and gradual, with no sharp transitions or distinct borders apart from the general color difference. There are no annotations, text, or additional graphical elements visible in the image.
