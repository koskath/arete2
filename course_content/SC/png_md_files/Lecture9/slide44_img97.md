The image consists of a series of vertical stripes that vary in color and width. On the far left is a very thin blue stripe, barely visible. Next to it is a wider stripe in a light grayish-tan color. Following this is a sequence of alternating gray, tan, and muted blue stripes, each with varying widths. Towards the middle of the image, the stripes transition into darker shades of gray, blue, and brown, with some very narrow stripes of almost black and dark green. 

In the central portion, there is a broad, distinct bright blue stripe, which is the widest and most prominent feature in the image. It is bordered by a very narrow dark stripe on the left and another narrow grayish-brown stripe on the right.

To the right of the bright blue stripe, the pattern of alternating colors continues, featuring more dark blues, browns, and grays. The sequence ends with another very thin blue stripe on the far right edge of the image. The overall appearance is a gradient of vertical stripes progressing from lighter to darker colors, with the bright blue stripe serving as a central focal point.
