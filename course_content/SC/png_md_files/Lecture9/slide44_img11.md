The image consists of a series of vertical lines that span the entire height of the image. On the left side, there is a mixture of thin, closely spaced lines in various shades of blue, gray, and black. As these lines move to the right, they vary in thickness, with some thicker lines situated among the thinner ones. The colors primarily include dark blues, deep grays, and a few lighter shades creating a gradient effect. 

Approximately midway across the image, there is a transition from the mixed lines to a solid, uniform deep blue section that extends to the right edge of the image. This uniform section occupies roughly half the width of the image on the right side, maintaining the same deep blue hue without any visible variations or textures. The overall pattern creates a contrast between the highly detailed, varying left side and the solid, consistent right side.
