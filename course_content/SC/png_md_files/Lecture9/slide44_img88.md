The image is composed of vertical stripes of varying widths, forming an abstract pattern. On the left side, there are thin stripes in colors that include shades of gray, blue, and black. As the image progresses towards the right, a prominent band of solid dark blue occupies nearly the entire right half of the image. To the far right, a narrow lighter blue stripe is visible. The transition from the left to the right through the stripes is smooth, with the colors and widths gradually shifting from numerous narrow multicolored lines to the broad single color band of blue. The overall tone of the image is varied, with a focus on blues and grays.
