The image shows a network diagram of a supply chain structure composed of rectangular boxes connected by arrows. The boxes are labeled with text to indicate different entities in the supply chain. Here's a detailed description of the elements and their relationships:

1. **Left Section**:
   - At the top, a box labeled "Manufacturer" is connected by a downward arrow to a box labeled "Supplier".
   - This "Supplier" box is also connected to three other boxes, each labeled "Supplier" and arranged below it, with each connection indicated by an arrow pointing upwards towards the central "Supplier".
   - The middle "Supplier" from the three is connected by two upward arrows leading to two separate boxes labeled "Manufacturer" and located above them.
   - These two "Manufacturer" boxes are each connected to one box labeled "Concentration Centre" above them with upward arrows.
   - The leftmost "Manufacturer" box is connected with a horizontal arrow to the "Supplier" box initially connected to the lower section.

2. **Right Section**:
   - Beginning with a box labeled "Distribution Centre" at the top right, an upward arrow connects to a box labeled "Manufacturer" below.
   - This "Manufacturer" is also connected by an upward arrow to a "Distribution Centre" box above it.
   - The "Distribution Centre" is connected by a downward arrow to a box labeled "Retailer Distribution Centre" below it.
   - The "Retailer Distribution Centre" connects via three arrows to three separate boxes labeled "Retailer", arranged around it, with two horizontal arrows pointing towards the left and one downwards.

The network has directional flow with arrows mostly pointing upwards towards "Concentration Centre" and "Distribution Centre" from lower levels, indicating the directional supply chain movement from suppliers toward the end stage, retailers.
