The image consists of a pattern of vertical lines primarily located on the left side. There are multiple lines, most of which are dark blue in color. They vary in width, with some lines being very thick and others much thinner. The lines are closely spaced with narrow white gaps between them, creating a barcode-like appearance. The right side of the image features a large white space, with a single thin light blue line running vertically from the top to the bottom, slightly to the left of the center of this white area. The edges on the left and bottom of the image are solid blue, while the top edge is distinctly white due to the background. The overall composition and color contrast between the dark blue lines and the white background are sharp, emphasizing the vertical linear patterns.
