The image contains a series of vertical blue lines of varying thicknesses against a white background. On the right side, some of the lines appear to be slightly angled or curved, bending towards the right. The lines are densely packed, particularly towards the left side, creating a gradient effect that transitions from a dense concentration to more sparse lines as they progress rightward. The background is uniformly white with no visible annotations or additional elements. There are no text, labels, or other markings visible in the image.
