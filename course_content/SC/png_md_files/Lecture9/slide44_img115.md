The image is a series of vertical stripes, each varying in width and color. Starting from the left:

1. A narrow pale band with light cream tones.
2. A slightly thicker vertical stripe in a dark yellowish hue.
3. Several closely spaced stripes follow, in varying shades of dark green to nearly black.
4. A broader stripe in grayish-green.
5. A band in muted gray.
6. Another broader dark band which transitions into a pale grayish shade.
7. A large bright blue vertical band dominates the right-center portion.
8. Right of the blue stripe are more narrow bands in pale blue and white.
9. Next is a noticeable dark gray band.
10. A series of narrow vertical bands transition from black to light gray.
11. Toward the far right, there is a maroon stripe.
12. Finally, a pale cream band concludes on the right edge.

The stripes are aligned vertically and the contrasts between each create a sharp delineation throughout the image.
