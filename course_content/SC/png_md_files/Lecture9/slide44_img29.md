The image features a vertical pattern composed of numerous parallel lines of varying widths and colors. On the left side, the lines are predominantly dark shades such as deep blue, gray, and black, intermixed with thinner lines of lighter or muted colors. There is a gradual transition to more prominent shades of deep blue as one moves to the right. The rightmost section of the image is dominated by a broad, solid vertical band of bright blue, contrasting with the more varied and complex line pattern on the left. The colors are generally cool-toned, and the overall effect is a blend of gradients and contrasts across the image.
