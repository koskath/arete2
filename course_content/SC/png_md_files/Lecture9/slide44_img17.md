The image is composed of vertical lines that span the entire height. On the right side, there is a large, solid vertical band of dark blue, taking up approximately one-third of the image's width. To the left of this band, there is a section with numerous narrow vertical stripes displaying a gradient effect. These stripes vary in color from dark gray, black, and light blue to shades of blue. The stripes appear to have a blurred and slightly translucent effect, creating a sense of depth and movement. The transition from the complex, narrow stripes to the solid blue band is smooth and continuous. The entire composition creates an abstract, modern visual effect with a focus on varying blue tones.
