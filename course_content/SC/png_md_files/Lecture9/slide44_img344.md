The image shows a barcode with alternating vertical lines of varying thicknesses. The lines are mostly black or dark blue in color. There are thin lines as well as thicker lines, creating a sequence of varying widths that are closely spaced together. There is a white background behind the lines, and the barcode extends vertically across the entire height of the image. Visible on the right and left sides are blue stripes that run parallel to the barcode lines, but they appear slightly faded compared to the main lines. There are no numbers or additional text present in the image. The lines are evenly spaced horizontally, forming the typical pattern of a standard barcode.
