The image consists of a narrow vertical strip on the left side, showing a streaked pattern of various colors. The rest of the image predominantly features the color white, occupying more than three-quarters of the space. Within the strip, colors transition smoothly in a gradient from light to dark hues. 

On the extreme left, there is a thin section of medium blue, transitioning into a beige area. This beige section gradually becomes darker, merging into a segment that includes a mix of light and dark blues. This transitions further into darker shades, predominantly navy and deep bluish colors. 

Adjacent to the navy, visible thin stripes of lighter blue and some tan are interspersed with darker areas. The strip features a subtle texture, but no distinct shapes or figures are discernable within the colors. The image features no text, figures, or discernable objects other than the described color gradients and patterns.
