The image shows a vertical barcode pattern with alternating thick and thin lines. The lines are predominantly dark blue and spaced against a white background. The sequence of lines starts with a thin line, followed by a thick line, and continues in a varying pattern of thickness and spacing. The left side of the barcode tapers off, extending slightly to the top edge of the image, while the right side tapers and extends slightly to the bottom edge. The lines are evenly aligned at the bottom, with no visible numbers or annotations beneath them. The overall structure is symmetrical in terms of the barcode's alignment along the center. There are no additional markings or extraneous elements visible outside of the barcode itself.
