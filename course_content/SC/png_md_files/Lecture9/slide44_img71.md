The image is divided into two main sections, with vertical lines spanning the entire height of the image.

On the left side of the image:
- There is a series of vertical lines with varying thicknesses and colors.
- The colors range from dark shades of blue, dark gray, and black to lighter grays and blues.
- These lines are tightly packed, with a more complex interplay of shades and hues.

In the middle and towards the right side of the image:
- A large, solid block of bright blue occupies this space.
- This section contrasts with the left side as it lacks the variation in color and is predominantly a single shade of blue, creating a uniform appearance.

At the extreme right and left edges:
- Thin vertical gray lines are present, marking the boundaries of the main sections.

Overall, the image juxtaposes a busy, multicolored section on the left with a stark, uniformly colored blue section across the majority of the image.
