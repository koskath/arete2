The positioning of the lines is primarily on the left half of the image, clustering closely together, and tapering slightly to a lesser density towards the center. The right half of the image is mostly empty, with one notable wide diagonal band in a gradient of blue crossing from the middle bottom towards the center right. The coloration within the lines and band transitions smoothly among lighter and darker shades.
