The image consists of multiple vertical stripes of varying thicknesses and colors. 

- On the far left, there is a thin stripe in a pale cream color.
- Adjacent to it is a very thin stripe of light blue.
- To the right, a slightly thicker black stripe is next to a dark gray stripe.
- There follows another black stripe, also thin, abutting a slightly wider stripe of medium gray.
- Next, a narrow stripe in a muted blue-gray color.
- Another black stripe is adjacent, wider than the previous ones.
- A series of thin stripes in shades of blue, ranging from deep navy to a lighter sky blue, interspersed with very thin black stripes, occupies the central part of the image.
- Moving further right, the stripes transition into a larger block of consistent dark blue, which occupies a substantial portion of the right half of the image.
- To the right edge, a narrow, bright blue stripe lines the edge.

The arrangement is symmetrical on the horizontal axis and absent of any text, labels, or annotations.
