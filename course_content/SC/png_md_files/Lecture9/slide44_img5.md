The image displays a vertical composition of parallel colored lines. On the left side, there is a series of thin, vertical stripes with varying shades of blue, ranging from light blue to darker blue hues. Some of the stripes are interspersed with thin lines of other colors, including purples and very dark tones, adding a textured effect. These stripes dominate the left third of the image.

As the eye moves to the right, the colors transition gradually into a solid area of darker blue that occupies the remaining two-thirds of the image. This blue section is uniform in color, appearing smooth without any visible texture or variation. The boundary between the striped area and the solid blue area is soft and appears to have a slight gradient effect.

There are no visible annotations, text, or markings. The overall appearance gives the impression of a change from a detailed pattern to a simpler, cleaner field of color from left to right. There are thin white borders on both the left and right edges of the image.
