The image consists of vertical, parallel lines of differing widths and colors. On the left side, there's a wide, solid light blue vertical stripe with a soft gradient, shading from left to right. Next to it is a series of thin, closely spaced vertical lines in shades of gray. These lines alternate between light gray and dark gray, creating a pattern. Towards the right, there are thicker, bolder vertical stripes in dark teal. These teal stripes are interspersed with thin white lines. The background is predominantly white, with the vertical lines contrasting against it. The overall composition is linear and structured, with clear demarcation between each section of lines.
