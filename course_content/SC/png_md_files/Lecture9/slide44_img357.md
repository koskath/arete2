The image features a series of vertical bars, resembling a barcode. On the left side, there is a broad blue gradient stripe, transitioning horizontally from a darker blue on the left edge to a lighter blue towards the right. Next to this stripe, starting from the center towards the right edge, is a sequence of dark blue and white vertical bars. These bars vary in width and spacing, with some thicker and spaced apart and others thinner and closely packed. The vertical bars extend from the top to the bottom of the image. There is a consistent white space towards the left and right edges, creating a border effect around the vertical bars and gradient stripe.
