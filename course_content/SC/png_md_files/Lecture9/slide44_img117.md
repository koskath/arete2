The image is composed entirely of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths. The predominant color palette includes shades of black, gray, beige, green, blue, and brown. The leftmost part begins with a dark stripe, primarily in shades of black or deep gray, followed immediately by a series of narrower stripes in lighter gray and green tones. These initial stripes transition into a central area featuring wider stripes dominated by gray, beige, and soft green hues. The right side of the image features a prominent bright blue stripe, which is notably wider than most others. Adjacent to this blue stripe is a sequence of stripes in lighter beige and brown, with a few lines appearing blurred or slightly mixed in color. The pattern suggests the effect of horizontal compression on a complex image, resulting in these uniform vertical strips. The stripes are closely aligned, and there are no gaps between them. The overall effect is a vertically streaked field across the entirety of the image.
