The image consists of a set of thin vertical lines on a white background. From left to right:

1. A very thin, dark blue line located near the left edge of the image.
2. Adjacent to the dark blue line, a thin light blue line runs parallel, slightly to the right.
3. Towards the center, there is a prominently thicker line with a gradient effect, transitioning from dark blue on the left to light blue on the right edge of the line.

Overall, the image features two thin lines and one thicker gradient line, all running vertically from top to bottom against a plain, white background.
