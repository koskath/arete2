The image contains a series of vertical blue lines of varying thickness against a white background. The lines are closely spaced, creating a pattern that spans the entire width of the image. The thickness of the lines ranges from very thin to moderately thick. The colors of the lines shift between different shades of blue, from light to dark. The lines appear uniformly arranged, extending vertically from the top to the bottom of the image, with some convergence and divergence creating a slight wave pattern. The overall arrangement gives a sense of movement and rhythm across the image due to the varying thickness and color intensity.
