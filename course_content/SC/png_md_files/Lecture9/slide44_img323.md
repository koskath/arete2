The image predominantly consists of several thin vertical lines on the left side. These lines are closely spaced, alternating between dark blue and white. The lines are parallel and vertically oriented, extending from the top to the bottom of the image. 

To the right of these lines, there is a single, wider diagonal stripe that slants from the top left towards the bottom right. This stripe is also dark blue with a gradient effect extending towards a lighter blue color on its edges. The white background behind these lines and stripe is otherwise plain, without any additional patterns, shapes, or annotations.
