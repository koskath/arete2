The image consists of a series of vertical lines predominantly filling the left and center portions of the image. These lines vary in color, ranging from shades of blue to hints of dark gray and black. The lines are densely packed together, with the blue hues appearing more prominent and frequent, intertwined with the darker and lighter stripes.

On the right side of the image, there is a large area of solid blue, contrasting sharply with the striped section. The transition from the densely-striped area to the solid color is abrupt, with the lines ceasing and giving way completely to the uninterrupted blue space.

There is a slight gradient visible in the solid blue area, becoming subtly lighter toward the top and bottom edges, but this gradient is very delicate and smooth compared to the sharp contrast of the lines.

The overall structure is predominantly linear, with the vertical orientation of the lines creating a strong directional pattern. The contrast between the densely-striped section and the solid blue area defines the image’s main visual characteristic.
