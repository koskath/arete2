The image consists of a series of vertical stripes spanning the entire height. On the far left, there is a very thin stripe in a light blue shade. Adjacent to it are multiple narrow vertical stripes with different shades and tints of blue, interspersed with dark grey or black stripes. These stripes vary widely in width, with some being extremely thin and others slightly broader, creating a multi-striped pattern with an overall dark appearance. 

As the image progresses to the right, the stripes gradually transition to a more uniform and consistent deep blue color with fewer variations in hue. The blue becomes richer and more solid as the stripes widen. Toward the far right, the blue appears almost uniform with minimal to no striping visible, creating a solid blue expanse. The entire image pattern reflects a transition from a varied multi-striped section on the left to a consistent deep blue section on the right.
