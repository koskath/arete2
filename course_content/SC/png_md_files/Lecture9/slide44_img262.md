The image consists of multiple vertical lines with varying widths. These lines are blue in color and are spaced irregularly across the horizontal plane of the image. There is a mixture of thick and thin lines, with some appearing very narrow while others are broader. The lines extend from the top to the bottom of the image. The background is predominantly white, offering a high contrast with the blue lines, making each line distinctly visible. The entire composition creates an abstract pattern with no additional elements, annotations, or discernible shapes beyond the lines themselves.
