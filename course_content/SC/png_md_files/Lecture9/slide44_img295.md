The image features a composition of vertical sections with distinct color areas. On the left side, there is a solid blue vertical band that occupies roughly one-third of the image width. Adjacent to the blue band, towards the center, is a white vertical strip, narrower than the blue band. Towards the right, there is a central section comprised of closely spaced vertical gray lines, giving a textured appearance. To the far right, another white vertical strip is visible, similar in width to the previous white strip. Between this white strip and the edge of the image, there is a narrow vertical area filled with a gradient of blue that fades into white, forming the rightmost part of the image. The overall layout consists of clean, sharply defined vertical divisions within the frame.
