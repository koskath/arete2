The image consists of two distinct areas. On the left, there is a large, empty white space that occupies approximately half of the image. To the right, there is a series of vertical, blurred, colorful stripes. These stripes include a range of colors such as browns, blues, and grays, blended together in a way that creates a gradient effect. The transition between the white space and the colorful stripes is not sharply defined but rather gradual, with the colors appearing to fade into the white area slightly.
