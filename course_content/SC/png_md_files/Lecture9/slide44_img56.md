The image consists of vertical stripes of varying colors and widths across the entire frame. On the left side, there are numerous thin vertical bands in various shades of blue and gray, intermixed with occasional lighter stripes of beige and light green. These bands appear tightly packed and have a somewhat blurry appearance, giving a sense of gradient transitions between the colors.

To the right side of the image, the pattern sharply transitions to a large, solid, and uniform deep blue section that occupies approximately half of the image's width. This large blue area has no visible texture or variations in shade.

The overall layout is composed of these two distinct sections, with the left side being more complex and detailed due to the multiple thin stripes, and the right side being simpler and dominated by the single color. There are no other visible structures, annotations, or text within the image.
