The image consists of multiple vertical, closely spaced blue stripes on a white background. The stripes vary in thickness, with some appearing as fine lines and others as broader bands. They are parallel to each other, distributed unevenly across the width of the image, and mainly concentrated on the left side. The largest stripe is towards the right of this group and slightly slanted compared to the others. Towards the right side of the image, there are fewer stripes and more white space, giving a sparse appearance.
