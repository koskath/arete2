The image shows a section of a barcode consisting of multiple thin vertical lines. These lines vary in thickness, with some lines being thicker while others are thinner. They are aligned parallel to each other, positioned close together. The barcode is set against a plain white background. On the right side, the lines taper off, almost disappearing into the white space. There is no text, numbers, or additional markings visible in this segment of the barcode. The linear pattern creates a visually dense, striped appearance focused primarily on the left side of the image, with a gradual fade towards the right.
