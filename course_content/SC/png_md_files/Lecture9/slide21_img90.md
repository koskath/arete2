The image is a gradient strip transitioning from dark gray at the top to black at the bottom. The gradient is smooth, with the darker gray occupying the upper third, gradually blending into a medium gray in the middle, and finally transitioning into pure black towards the bottom, occupying the lower third. The transition between the colors is seamless, without any distinct lines or breaks. There are no other visible elements, annotations, structures, or shapes present in the image.
