The image shows a series of vertical lines occupying the left half of the image. These lines alternate in thickness, with dark blue and white lines creating a stripe pattern. The dark blue lines are prominent and slightly thicker compared to the white gaps between them. On the right, the blue lines slant diagonally upwards towards the right edge of the image, maintaining their thickness, and leading to a narrowing gap before reaching the edge. The overall appearance suggests a transition from structured vertical stripes on the left to a more dynamic, diagonal arrangement towards the right. The background is entirely white.
