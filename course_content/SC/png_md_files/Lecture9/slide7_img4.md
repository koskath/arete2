The image is a flowchart illustrating a supply chain network. The chart is structured with a hierarchical layout featuring hexagonal and rectangular shapes connected by arrows. At the top, there is a label "Manufacturing" without a specific shape.

Below this label are four connected hexagonal shapes, each representing different manufacturing sources:
1. “Manufacturing Denmark”
2. “Manufacturing Hungary”
3. “Packaging Czech Rep.”
4. “Outsourced Mfg EU/Asia”

Each of these hexagons has a solid black line arrow pointing downwards to a central rectangle labeled “EDC Jirny.” The rectangle acts as a central distribution center connecting multiple processes.

From the central rectangle “EDC Jirny,” there are three horizontal arrows extending outward:
1. An arrow pointing left goes to a rectangle labeled “DC’s Overseas,” which connects to another leftward arrow pointing to a hexagon labeled “Non-European Customers.”
2. An arrow pointing right goes to a rectangle labeled “Shop@Home Denmark,” which further directs a right-pointing arrow to a hexagon labeled "Consumers.”
3. A downward-pointing arrow from “EDC Jirny” leads to a hexagon labeled “European Customers.”

The flowchart uses solid lines for arrows and shapes are outlined with thin borders. The layout clearly divides manufacturing processes, distribution centers, and final customers into distinct sections for easy visual tracking.
