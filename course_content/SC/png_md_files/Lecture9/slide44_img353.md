The image contains a simple composition of two lines against a white background. On the left, there is a thin vertical line that is light gray in color. To the right, a wider, slightly diagonal line spans from the upper left to the lower right of the frame. This line transitions from a light blue at the top to a darker blue as it reaches the bottom. The rest of the image is plain white, providing no additional elements or details.
