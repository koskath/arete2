The image contains a series of vertical colored lines. On the left side, there is a variety of predominantly dark colors, including blacks, grays, and deep blues, with narrow vertical stripes. As the image moves toward the right, the colors become more vibrant and accumulate into a solid block of rich blue starting about a third of the way in from the left. This blue is consistent until it reaches the far right of the image. There is no visible text, patterns, or other designs; the focus is solely on the gradual transition from the multicolored lines to the dense blue expanse. The overall effect is a smooth gradient from left to right from a chaotic mix of dark colors to a uniform color field.
