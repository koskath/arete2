A long, narrow image featuring a blurry pattern of horizontal lines with varying shades of green and gray. The top of the image is mostly dark green, followed by alternating lighter and darker green stripes. The middle section is dominated by a dark band with a distinct gray strip below it. Towards the bottom, the pattern continues with dark green and subtle gray lines. The overall appearance is abstract, lacking discernible shapes or objects, with a smooth, gradient-like transition between the different colors across the image. The left and right edges of the image mirror each other, maintaining horizontal symmetry.
