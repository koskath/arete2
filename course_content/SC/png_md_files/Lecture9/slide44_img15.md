The image consists of a series of vertical stripes spanning the entire width of the image. On the left side, the stripes are very narrow and vary in color, including shades of blue, black, gray, and brown. The stripes are densely packed and show a gradual transition between colors. As the eye moves to the right, the stripes become progressively thicker and more uniformly blue. The rightmost portion of the image displays a solid block of deep blue that occupies approximately one-third of the image width. This section is devoid of any variation or patterns, presenting a continuous, homogenous appearance. There are no annotations, labels, or additional visual elements present in the image.
