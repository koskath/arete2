The image consists of a series of vertical blue and grey lines of varying thicknesses and shades stretched across a white background. The lines are closely spaced together. There are no annotations, shapes, or additional structures visible in the image. The arrangement creates a pattern across the majority of the width of the image, with a gradient effect where the density and intensity of the lines may vary slightly. There is no additional text, objects, or elements present.
