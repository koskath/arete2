The image consists of a series of vertical lines on a horizontal plane. On the left half, there is a wide cluster of vertical stripes in various shades of blue, ranging from light to dark, creating a gradient effect. The center of the cluster has darker, deeper blues, while the outer edges transition to lighter shades. These lines are densely packed with minimal white space separating them.

On the right half of the image, the lines become more sparse, with a white background occupying more space between them. The stripes in this area are thinner and darker, mostly in shades of dark blue and black, with greater contrast against the white background.

The overall composition is symmetrical in terms of color gradient from one side to the other but varies in the density and spacing of the lines. The top and bottom borders of the image appear to have narrow white margins enclosing the pattern.
