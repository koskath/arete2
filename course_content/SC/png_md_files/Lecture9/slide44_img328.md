The image features a barcode against a white background. The barcode consists of a series of vertical black lines of varying thickness and spacing. To the left, there is a vertical thin blue line. In the middle, several black lines are tightly grouped, creating a dense area. The lines are evenly spaced, with alternating thick and thin widths. There is a noticeable gap after this dense section, followed by more lines. There is a slight curvature to the barcode lines, especially towards the center-right, where the lines appear to tilt slightly to the right. The entire barcode extends vertically, spanning the height of the image.
