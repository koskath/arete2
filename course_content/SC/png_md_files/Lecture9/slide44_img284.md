The image consists of several vertical bands on a white background. On the left side, there is a wide, solid blue vertical strip. To its right are several narrow, closely spaced vertical lines. The central group consists of alternating light grey and dark grey vertical lines. Adjacent to these, there is a very thin, light blue vertical line. Further to the right, there is another broad blue strip followed by multiple parallel lines in shades of blue, with varying widths, forming a dense cluster. The lines and strips are neatly aligned and extend vertically from the top to the bottom of the image.
