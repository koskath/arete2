The image consists of a series of vertical and horizontal lines with varying shades of gray against a light gray background. The vertical lines are densely packed on the left side, gradually decreasing in density towards the center where they taper off. These lines create a gradient effect transitioning from dark to light. The horizontal lines are more widely spaced and consistent in thickness. They run parallel to each other from the right edge towards the left, intersecting with the vertical lines. The intersection creates a grid-like pattern with a textured appearance in the top half, transitioning to solid black in the bottom area of the image. There are no annotations, shapes, or prominent structures aside from the lines and grid pattern.
