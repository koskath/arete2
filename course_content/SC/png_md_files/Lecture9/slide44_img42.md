The image consists of a series of vertical stripes of varying widths. The stripes are arranged closely together across the entire image. Starting from the left, the colors transition from light to dark hues. The leftmost section features thinner stripes of light blue, cyan, and aqua, interspersed with very dark blues and blacks. As the stripes progress towards the right, they increase in width and transition into darker shades of blue. 

Approximately one third into the image, the stripes become predominately medium to dark blues, with occasional thin black stripes. Beyond this point, the stripes are dominated by a solid and consistent dark blue color that occupies about the rightmost third of the image. The transition from varied colorful stripes to a uniform dark blue mass is smooth and progressive. The entire image presents a gradient from a multicolor to a predominantly single-color scheme. There are no other visible annotations, shapes, or structures in the image.
