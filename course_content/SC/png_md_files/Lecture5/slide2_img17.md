The image shows four vertical, parallel blue lines on a white background. The lines vary in thickness, with the first line on the left being the thickest and a dark solid blue. The next two lines to the right are narrower than the first, still solid blue, and are closely spaced. The fourth line is very thin, also in solid blue. To the right of these lines, there is a partial view of a letter "N" drawn in blue, with the vertical stroke on the right side visible and slightly bent as it moves from bottom to top. The background remains entirely white throughout the image, providing a stark contrast to the deep blue of the lines and letter.
