The image consists of a deep blue background with two prominent white triangular shapes. These shapes are positioned vertically and symmetrically in the image, with the bases at the bottom and the pointed tips toward the top. The tips of the triangles slightly blur into the blue background, creating a gradient effect. The spacing between the two white triangles is narrow and centered horizontally within the frame. The top of the triangles fades smoothly into the blue, suggesting a merge or transition. The triangles and background dominate the entire image with no additional elements or annotations present.
