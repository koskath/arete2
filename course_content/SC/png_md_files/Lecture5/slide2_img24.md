The image consists entirely of a solid field of blue color, except for a narrow white triangular shape pointing upward near the bottom-right corner. The blue is a uniform hue and covers the entire visible area, with no texture or gradient. The white triangular shape is sharply defined against the blue background, creating a contrast between the two colors. No other visible details, structures, shapes, annotations, or spatial elements are present.
