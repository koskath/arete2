A predominantly white background with a bold blue diagonal stripe on the left extending from the top left corner downwards. To the right of this stripe, partially visible letters "IVI" are present, written in a dark blue font. The background is otherwise plain, with a slight gradient visible near the edges of the letters. The letters appear unfinished, with their top segments slightly cut off by the top edge of the image. The overall arrangement suggests a zoomed or cropped view of a larger design.
