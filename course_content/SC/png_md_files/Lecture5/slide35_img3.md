The image contains three horizontally aligned sections below three words. Each section transitions from green on the left to other colors on the right. 

1. At the top, three words are spaced evenly across:
   - The word "predict" is positioned over the left section, centrally aligned.
   - The phrase "on average" is positioned over the middle section, centrally aligned.
   - The word "predict" is again positioned over the right section, centrally aligned.

2. The sections below the words are:
   - A left rectangle with a rounded edge on the left side, filled with a gradient transitioning from a bright green at the left side to a lighter green towards the right.
   - A middle rectangle without rounded edges, filled with a gradient transitioning from a bright green at the left side to a lighter green towards the right.
   - A right rectangle with a rounded edge on the right side, filled with a gradient transitioning from a green at the left side to a mix of green and other colors, such as orange or beige, towards the right.

The background color is a light gray, and the text is in a darker gray.
