The image is a diagram consisting of various elements:

1. **Axes and Lines:**
   - There is a horizontal axis at the bottom with an arrow pointing to the right, indicating a progression or flow in that direction.
   - A vertical axis on the left with an arrow pointing upwards.

2. **Zigzag Pattern:**
   - A thick, continuous zigzag line is plotted within the confines of the axes.
   - The zigzag pattern consists of three peaks and three valleys and is located inside a rectangular area outlined with dashed lines.
   - The line starts from the left bottom, ascends to form a peak, descends to a valley, and repeats this two more times.

3. **Dashed Lines:**
   - There are three evenly spaced vertical dashed lines intersecting the zigzag pattern, dividing the horizontal axis into equal segments.
   - A horizontal dashed line extends from the top of the vertical dashed lines across the diagram.

4. **Annotations and Marks:**
   - The letter "S" is indicated near the beginning of the vertical axis.
   - Each segment between the vertical dashed lines on the horizontal axis is marked with the letter "t", indicating a consistent interval or period, resulting in three "t" labels.
   - Arrows below the horizontal axis point towards the "t" marks, emphasizing each interval.
   - Triangular arrows above and below the bracket connecting the "t" marks indicate directionality or movement.

5. **Overall Layout:**
   - The diagram is structured in a way to suggest a repeating pattern or cycle with consistent intervals marked by "t".
   - The zigzag pattern and annotations are all confined within a dashed rectangular boundary.
