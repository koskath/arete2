The image consists of a white background with a diagonal blue shape in the upper left corner. This shape resembles a distorted triangle or wedge, where the top edge is parallel to the top border of the image. The blue color is solid and appears to be the only specific color present apart from the white. There are no visible text, annotations, or additional details other than the sharply defined contrast between the blue shape and the white background. The blue shape occupies only a small portion of the image predominantly at the top left, gradually narrowing as it extends toward the right.
