The image displays a graph with a jagged line pattern representing inventory levels over time. The x-axis is horizontal, extending from left to right, while the y-axis is vertical, extending upward from the origin at the bottom left. 

Two dashed horizontal lines are present:
1. The upper dashed line, labeled "S" to the left, lies near the top of the graph.
2. The lower dashed line, labeled "s" to the left, is situated below the "S" line.

The jagged line starts near the intersection of the x-axis and y-axis and rises to intersect the "S" line, then sharply drops, reaching below the "s" line. This pattern repeats multiple times across the graph, with the line oscillating between rising above the "S" line and dropping below the "s" line.

Five arrows point upwards from the x-axis, correlating with each time the jagged line touches or crosses the "s" line from above. Each arrow is connected to the "s" line by a vertical dashed line, signifying reorder points. The arrows are evenly spaced across the x-axis, creating intervals that represent cycles in the inventory levels.

The overall shape of the inventory path is that of recurring peaks and troughs, illustrating a cycle of stock refills when the reorder point is hit and subsequent consumption that brings it back down toward that point over time.
