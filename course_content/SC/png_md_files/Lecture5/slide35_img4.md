The image is divided into four vertical sections. 

- The first section on the left is a narrow black vertical band.
  
- The second section features a light gray background with large bold dark gray text at the top reading "A." Below this, in smaller bold dark gray text, it states "High volume or high value share."

- The third section has a gradient green background with white text centered in the middle, stating "Stable and constant demand."

- The fourth section has a gradient green background with white text centered stating "Fluctuating demand."

- The fifth section, on the far right, has a gradient transitioning from green at the top left to red at the bottom right, with white text centered reading "Irregular demand." 

Each of the text sections is aligned horizontally across the middle of their respective background. The gradient backgrounds transition smoothly from left to right in the green sections and from green to red in the rightmost section. The text is evenly spaced and clear, with no additional graphics or annotations present.
