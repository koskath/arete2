The image features a graph with a zigzag line, representing a repeated pattern of decrease and increase over time. The horizontal axis is an unlabeled timeline, while the vertical axis represents a quantity or level.

1. **Axes**:
   - The horizontal axis is solid, extending from the left to the right with an arrow at the end, indicating a timeline or progression.
   - The vertical axis is solid, extending from the bottom upwards with an arrow at the top, indicating a quantity or level.

2. **Zigzag Line**:
   - Begins from a higher point on the left side and descends in a line, then sharply ascends and descends repetitively, forming a zigzag pattern.
   - The descending lines are steeper compared to the ascending lines.

3. **Dashed Horizontal Line**:
   - A dashed horizontal line labeled “S” runs parallel to the horizontal axis and intersects each peak of the zigzag pattern.

4. **Annotations and Arrows**:
   - At each ascending section of the zigzag line, the letter "Q" is placed next to it.
   - Three vertical dashed lines drop from points where the zigzag line intersects with the dashed horizontal “S” line down to the timeline axis.
   - At the base of each vertical dashed line, a solid horizontal arrow points upwards, indicating the start of an ascent in the zigzag line.

5. **Spatial Relationships**:
   - The peaks of the zigzag meet the dashed horizontal line labeled “S.”
   - The distance between each vertical dashed line appears uniform, indicating consistent intervals.
   - Each descending segment of the zigzag ends at a higher point than it starts.

This graph illustrates a recurring pattern of depletion and replenishment over time, with annotations suggesting a cycle labeled by “Q” at each renewal point crossing the "S" threshold. The solid arrows at the base of each vertical dashed line suggest points of incremental change.
