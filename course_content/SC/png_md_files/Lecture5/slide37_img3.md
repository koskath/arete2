The image consists of two separate line graphs arranged vertically, with an arrow pointing downward connecting them. 

**Top Graph:**
- The graph is rectangular and has horizontal and vertical lines.
- The vertical axis is labeled with numbers: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300.
- The horizontal axis is labeled with numbers from 1 to 31, showing increments primarily of 1.
- A horizontal line of connected black dots runs across, depicting demand fluctuations; the dots vary slightly above and below the 100 mark.
- Positioned to the right of this graph, there is the text: "Demand at distribution centre C: Safety stock = 12."

**Bottom Graph:**
- Similarly shaped, this graph also features horizontal and vertical lines.
- Its vertical axis is labeled exactly as the top graph: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300.
- The horizontal axis again ranges from 1 to 31.
- The pattern of black dots here is similarly connected, fluctuating above and below the 250 mark.
- Positioned to the right of this graph, there is the text: "Demand at central location: Safety stock = 62."

The arrow between the two graphs is a simple, unadorned downward pointing arrow connecting the top and bottom graphs, suggesting a transition or relationship between the two datasets.
