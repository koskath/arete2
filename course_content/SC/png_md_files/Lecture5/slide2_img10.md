The image consists of a horizontal strip with a dominant blue and white color scheme. 

On the left side, there's a concentrated solid dark blue area. Moving towards the right, the blue area splits into two triangular shapes. One is smaller, extending to the top of the image, and the other is larger, extending toward the bottom, creating a sharp, pointed edge on the left side.

Inside the lower blue triangular shape, there is a number "19" in a blue font on a white background. The number is slightly slanted and located towards the bottom right area of the strip.

Beyond the numbers and triangular shapes, the rest of the background remains white, contrasting sharply with the blue design elements. There are no additional annotations, images, or markings visible.
