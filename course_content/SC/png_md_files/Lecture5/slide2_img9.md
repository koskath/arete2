The image contains an abstract pattern composed mainly of blue and white colors. There are triangular shapes pointing upwards and downwards, creating a zigzag pattern across the image. These angular shapes alternate between blue and white. The blue areas have pointed peaks, while the white areas are more irregular in shape and seem to split or break the blue sections. Toward the lower right corner, there is text oriented diagonally upwards from left to right, displaying the number "1911" in blue. The background is uniform white where no blue coloring is present. The composition primarily emphasizes the contrast between the blue and white, with the number providing a minimal textual element.
