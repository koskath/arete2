The image consists of a grid of six rectangular panels arranged in two rows and three columns on a light gray background.

**Top Row (Left to Right):**
1. The first panel on the top left is a rectangle with a gradient fill transitioning from green on the left side to a slightly lighter green on the right side.
2. The middle panel on the top row has a gradient fill transitioning from green on the left side to a mix of green and beige in the center, then to a more pronounced beige towards the right side.
3. The top right panel has a gradient fill transitioning from a mix of green and beige on the left side to a gradual change into red at the right side.

**Bottom Row (Left to Right):**
1. The bottom left panel is a rectangle with a gradient fill transitioning from green on the left side to a lighter green on the right, similar to the top left panel.
2. The middle panel on the bottom row has a gradient fill beginning with a mix of green and beige on the left side, transitioning to a balanced blend of the colors towards the center, and leaning more heavily towards red on the right.
3. The bottom right panel is filled with a gradient transitioning from a beige shade on the left to a deep red on the right.

There are white borders both vertically between the columns and horizontally between the rows, separating each panel. The panels each have soft color transitions with some diagonal gradient lines visible.
