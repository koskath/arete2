The image depicts a diagram with a sequence of zigzag lines, representing a repeating pattern.

1. **Axes**:
   - The horizontal axis extends to the right and is marked with an arrow at its end, indicating positive direction.
   - The vertical axis extends upward with an arrow on top, indicating positive direction.
   - Neither axis has numerical labels or specific identifiers.

2. **Zigzag Pattern**:
   - There are four segments of the thick black zigzag line, each rising to the right, then sharply dropping before rising again.
   - Each sequence forms a peak and a trough.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The letter "Q" is placed three times horizontally alongside the descending segments of the zigzag lines.
   - Each "Q" is consistently placed slightly to the right of the descending sections.

4. **Dashed Lines**:
   - Three vertical dashed lines are positioned equidistant from each other, intersecting the zigzag pattern at its peak or trough points.
   - These lines divide the pattern into three identical segments visually.

5. **Horizontal Arrows and Labels**:
   - Below the dashed lines, there are three double-headed arrows, aligned horizontally, labeled "t".
   - Each double-headed arrow spans the distance between two consecutive vertical dashed lines.
   - The arrows and the "t" labels indicate equal periodic segments or intervals along the horizontal axis.

6. **Spatial Relationships**:
   - Each "Q" appears approximately midway down each descending segment of the zigzag pattern.
   - The intervals labeled "t" underline the regularity of the repetition across the diagram.
   - Vertical dashed lines help demarcate transitions between each segment of the recurring pattern.

The overall arrangement suggests a cyclic or periodic process without any specific quantity or dimensional references.
