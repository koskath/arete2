The image consists of several distinct sections with the following characteristics:

1. At the top, there is a horizontal blue band running across the width of the image, occupying about one-third of the vertical space.
2. Below the blue band, there is a diagonal white area extending from the top left to the bottom right. 
3. The bottom section displays a wavy pattern of alternating thin lines in dark blue and lighter colors, toward the lower left corner.
4. Toward the right, within the white area, there are fragments of red and blue text visible, although they are incomplete and partially cut off.
5. The red text is at the top part of this section and the blue text is below it, slanted upwards from left to right.
6. The background surrounding these elements is primarily black, filling all remaining space in the image.
