The image contains a portion of a composition featuring sharp geometric shapes and colors. On the left side, a solid dark blue triangular shape occupies the majority of the image, with its base along the left edge and its point extending to the right. Adjacent to this blue triangle, there is a white triangular section that separates the blue shape from a collection of alternating dark blue and white slanted stripes. These stripes are parallel to each other and slant towards the left, creating a pattern of blue-white-blue-white, etc.

Above this pattern, a portion of text is visible, beginning with the letter "j" and followed by other letters obscured by the angle or cropping, appearing to be part of a larger word. The text is dark blue, matching the color of the large triangle and stripes. The background on the right portion of the image is white, providing a stark contrast to the dark blue elements and enhancing their visibility.
