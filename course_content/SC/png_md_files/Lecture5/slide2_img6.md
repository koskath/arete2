The image consists of abstract shapes with blue and white colors. There are three distinct blue areas: 

1. On the left side, a vertical, slightly curved blue shape extends from the top to the bottom of the image, with uneven white spaces between it and other blue areas. 

2. In the central region, there is a larger, more prominent curved blue shape that starts from near the top and curves slightly to the right before tapering down.

3. To the right, another angled blue shape appears, oriented diagonally from the top left towards the bottom right.

White areas are interspersed within these blue shapes, appearing as negative spaces with soft, irregular edges. The background is predominantly blue, serving as a backdrop for the white spaces within and around the shapes, creating a contrast between the two colors. The overall composition is dynamic, with a sense of motion conveyed by the curves and angles.
