The image displays a horizontal layout with three main sections. Each section appears as a rectangle with a vertical gradient fill, transitioning from a lighter shade on the left side to a darker shade on the right. These sections are positioned side by side, separated by vertical white bars.

1. **Left Section**: This section begins with a gradient that starts as a brownish-orange on the left, transitioning to a light red hue to the right. The top left corner of this section is rounded.

2. **Middle Section**: The middle section also features a gradient fill, starting from a light red on the left and darkening to a deeper red toward the right.

3. **Right Section (Partially Visible)**: The right edge of the image shows a small part of another section or rectangle that appears similar to the others, predominantly in a red tone.

The background of the image is light gray, and the bottom edge is sleek and slightly rounded. The overall visual effect is smooth and modern, with a clean separation between sections.
