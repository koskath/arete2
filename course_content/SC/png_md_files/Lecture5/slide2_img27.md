The image features a pattern composed of alternating blue and white vertical shapes. There are four white stripes arranged vertically against a solid blue background. Each white stripe varies in width and has a slightly irregular, tapering shape, starting wide at the top and narrowing as it descends. The blue background is uniform and consistent throughout the image, with no discernible texture or shading. The white stripes are evenly spaced across the image, creating a balanced, symmetrical pattern. The overall composition is abstract, with no additional elements, text, or annotations present.
