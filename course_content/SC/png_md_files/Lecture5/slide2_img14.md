The image consists of three main sections:

1. **Left Section**: A large, solid vertical dark blue stripe occupies the left side of the image, extending from the top to the bottom.

2. **Middle Section**: A diagonal area featuring alternating dark blue and white parallel stripes. These stripes are angled from the top left to the bottom right.

3. **Text Section**: Partially visible text in the upper right area which is slightly italicized and reads "agram" against a white background. The text is in blue, and the top of the text is truncated, so only part of the letters is visible.
