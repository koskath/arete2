The image contains a grid layout of six rectangular gradient blocks arranged in two rows with three blocks per row. Each block features a gradient that transitions from one color to another. 

- The upper left block displays a gradient transitioning from a light green on the left to a soft red on the right. 

- The block to its right also has a gradient, moving from a very pale red towards a slightly deeper shade of red.

- The upper right block continues with a gradient, showing a light red gradually intensifying to a bold red by the far right side.

- The lower left block has a gradient that transitions from a muted red on the left to a stronger red on the right. 

- The center block in the bottom row starts with a very light red hue on the left, intensifying as it moves to the right.

- The bottom right block displays a gradient from red at the left to a more intense red on the right side.

Each block is separated by a thin gray border, and the background of the overall grid is a light gray color.
