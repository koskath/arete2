The image contains two line graphs arranged vertically, side by side with text annotations on the right. 

**Top Graph:**

- **Axes:** 
  - X-axis: Labeled with numbers from 1 to 31, evenly spaced.
  - Y-axis: Labeled with numbers from 0 to 350, in increments of 50.

- **Lines and Markers:**
  - Multiple horizontal dashed lines across different Y-axis values: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300.
  - A solid line with circular markers, fluctuating near the bottom region between 0 and 100 on the Y-axis.

- **Text Annotation:**
  - Positioned to the right of the graph: "Demand at distribution centre A: Safety stock = 35"

**Bottom Graph:**

- **Axes:** 
  - X-axis: Labeled with numbers from 1 to 31, evenly spaced, same as the top graph.
  - Y-axis: Labeled with numbers from 0 to 350, in increments of 50, same as the top graph.

- **Lines and Markers:**
  - Multiple horizontal dashed lines across different Y-axis values: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300.
  - A solid line with circular markers, showing a zigzag pattern that fluctuates more dramatically between 0 and 200 on the Y-axis compared to the top graph.

- **Text Annotation:**
  - Positioned to the right of the graph: "Demand at distribution centre B: Safety stock = 60"

The graphs are enclosed in separate rectangular boxes with neatly defined borders.
