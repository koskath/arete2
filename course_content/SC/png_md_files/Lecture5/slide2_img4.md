The image consists of a background that is entirely blue. In the foreground, four white, narrow, vertical shapes are positioned across the image. These shapes are irregular and slightly wave-like, resembling abstract drips or streaks. Each shape varies slightly in width, but all are similarly spaced from one another. The shapes extend from the top edge of the image to the bottom, with a slight lean or curve to the left or right. The blue background is uniformly colored, providing a stark contrast to the white shapes. There are no annotations, labels, or additional elements present in the image.
