The image is divided into four vertical sections. 

The left-most section is a light gray column with the letter "B" at the top, written in bold, large, dark gray font. Below the letter "B," the text "Volume or value share on average" is written in smaller, bold, dark gray font.

The second section from the left is a gradient rectangle transitioning from a darker to a lighter shade of green. Centered within this section, the text "Stable and constant demand" is displayed in bold, white font.

The third section is a gradient rectangle with colors blending from green on the left to a light orange-red on the right. Centered in this section, the text "Fluctuating demand" is in bold, white font.

The right-most section is a gradient rectangle transitioning from a lighter to a darker red hue. Centered in this section, the text "Irregular demand" is written in bold, white font.

The sections are separated by thin, vertical white lines, except for the left-most gray column, which does not have a visible divider on its left side.
