# Slide 8 of Lecture 5 contains information about the Dimensionality Reduction.

Dimensionality reduction has applications in machine learning, data mining, bioinformatics, biometrics, and information retrieval, and can be visualized, for example, with a multidimensional cube on which slicing operations separate different dimensions.
