# Slide 17 of Lecture 5 contains information about the PCA Example: MNIST Compression.

In the MNIST compression example, PCA is applied to preserve 95% of the dataset’s variance, reducing each instance from 784 features to just over 150 while shrinking the overall dataset to less than 20% of its original size.
