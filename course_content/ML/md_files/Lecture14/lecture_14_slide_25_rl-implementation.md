# Slide 25 of Lecture 14 contains information about the RL Implementation.

• Types of RL implementations:
• Policy-based RL uses a policy or
deterministic strategy that maximizes
cumulative reward.
• Value-based RL tries to maximize an arbitrary
value function.
• Model-based RL creates a virtual model for a
certain environment and agent learns to
perform within those constraints.
• In RL, data is accumulated during trial-and-error
method.
• Data is not part of input.
• Classic Atari games have been used as a test bed
for RL algorithms.
