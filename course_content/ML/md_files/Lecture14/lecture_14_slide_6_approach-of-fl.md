# Slide 6 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Approach of FL.

1. To guarantee data privacy, FL permits all
remote devices exchange model gradient with

2. During this process, each distributed devices

3. Then they upload local model to central
server.
4. After aggregating all gathered models, server
