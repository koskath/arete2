# Slide 16 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Other Issues.

1. High network bandwidth
2. Transparency: Training data are kept private, [testing accuracy, fairness,
and potential biases in model’s output]
3. Accountability: Logging each stage of pipeline is needed.
4. Data Control: What data go into the model? and How to delete them when a
host leaves?
• Rule: if data are deleted, parties are obligated to retrain model from
scratch.
5. Trust issue
