# Slide 10 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Transfer Learning (TL).

• In TL, a model pre-trained on one task is fine-tuned for a new, related task.
• Use TL to retrain existing models on related tasks with new data.
• For example, if a model can identify images of dogs, it can be trained to
identify cats using a smaller image set that highlights the feature
differences between dogs and cats.
• Advantage: time and cost savings [NLP, Image processing use case]
• Application: Transfer learning strategies are critical for generative AI adoption
in various industries.
