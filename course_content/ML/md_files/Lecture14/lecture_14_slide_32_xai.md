# Slide 32 of Lecture 14 contains information about the XAI.

• Regular AI vs XAI?
• XAI implements specific techniques and methods to ensure that each decision
made during ML process can be traced and explained.
• AI arrives at a result using an ML algorithm, but architects of the AI systems do not
fully understand how the algorithm reached that result.
• Issue: Hard to check for accuracy and leads to loss of control, accountability and
auditability.
• XAI consists of:
• Prediction accuracy.
• Traceability is achieved by limiting scope narrower for rules and features.
• Decision understanding addresses human needs (trust).
• Applications: Healthcare, Finance.
