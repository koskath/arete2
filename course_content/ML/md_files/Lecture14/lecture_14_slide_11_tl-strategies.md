# Slide 11 of Lecture 14 contains information about the TL Strategies.

• Transductive transfer learning involves transferring knowledge from a specific source
domain to a related target domain [primary focus]
• Adv: Little or no labeled data from target domain. Use previously-gained
knowledge.
• Application: Adapting a sentiment analysis model trained on product reviews to
analyze movie reviews.
• Inductive transfer learning: Here source and target domains are same, but tasks are
different.
• Adv: Faster training as pre-trained model is already familiar with source data.
• Application: [NLP] Pre-trained on a large set of texts and then tune to sentiment
analysis.
