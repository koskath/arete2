# Slide 14 of Lecture 14 contains information about the TL Steps.

• Transfer learning works best :
• Both learning tasks are similar
• Source and target data distributions do not vary too much.
• A comparable model can be applied to both tasks.
• Note: Transfer learning Vs finetuning:
• Finetuning refers to the process of further training a model on a task-specific dataset
to improve performance on the initial, specific task for which the model was built.
• TL signifies when users adapt a model to a new, related problem as opposed to same
problem.
