# Slide 35 of Lecture 14 contains information about the XAI.

• Advantages:
• Operationalize AI with trust and confidence
• Better optimization.
• Manage regulatory, compliance, risk and other requirements.
• Considerations for XAI:
• Fairness and debiasing
• Model drift mitigation: Alert when models deviate from intended outcomes.
• Model risk management: Quantify and mitigate model risk. Understand what happened
when deviations persist.
• Lifecycle automation: Build, run and manage models as part of integrated data and AI
services. Explain model dependencies.
• Deployment
• Issue: Risk of over-simplifying and/or misrepresenting complicated systems.
