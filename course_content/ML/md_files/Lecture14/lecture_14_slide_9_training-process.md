# Slide 9 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Training Process.

1. Horizontal Learning: Central model is trained on similar datasets.
2. Vertical Learning: Data are complementary.
• E.g., Movie and book reviews, are combined to predict someone’s music
preferences.
3. Transfer Learning: Pre-trained foundation model designed to perform one
task, (detecting cars), is trained on another dataset to do something else,
(identify cats).
