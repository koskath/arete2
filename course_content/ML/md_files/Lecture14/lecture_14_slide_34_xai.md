# Slide 34 of Lecture 14 contains information about the XAI.

• There is a lack of consensus on definitions XAI terms explainability and interpretability
• Explainability versus interpretability:
• Explainability looks at how AI arrived at the result.
• Interpretability is success rate that humans can predict for AI result of an output.
• Differences between XAI and responsible AI:
• XAI looks at AI results after results are computed.
• Responsible AI looks at AI during planning stages to make AI algorithm responsible
before results are computed.
• Explainable and responsible AI can work together to make better AI.
