# Slide 39 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Summary (2/2).

• Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a process where a computer agent learns to
perform a task through trial and error interactions with a dynamic environment,
without relying on a static dataset. The goal is to maximise total cumulative
reward.
• RL involves defining the environment, specifying a reward signal, creating an
agent with a policy and training algorithm, training the agent, and then
deploying the learned policy.
• Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make the decision-making
processes of AI systems understandable and trustworthy for humans.
• XAI is important for ensuring project requirements are met, promoting user
trust, enabling model auditability, and mitigating various risks associated with
AI deployment.
• Goal of XAI is to produce more explainable models while maintaining high
prediction accuracy, enabling humans to understand, trust, and manage AI
systems.
