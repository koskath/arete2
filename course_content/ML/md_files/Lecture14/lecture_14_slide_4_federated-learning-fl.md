# Slide 4 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Federated Learning (FL).

• Google introduced term "federated learning" in 2016.
• A way to train AI models without anyone seeing or touching user private
data.
• By processing data at their source, FL allows raw data streaming (from
sensors).
• Benefits: Allow to collaboratively train a decentralized model without
sharing confidential data.
• Financial Application: Aggregate customer financial records could allow banks
to generate more accurate customer credit scores or improve their ability to
detect fraud.
