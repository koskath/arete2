# Slide 26 of Lecture 14 contains information about the RL Example: Car Parking.

• Goal: Teach vehicle computer (agent) to park in correct parking spot.
• Environment: is everything outside agent and include dynamics of vehicle, other nearby
vehicles, weather conditions, and others.
• Training: Agent uses readings from sensors (cameras, GPS, and lidar) to generate
steering, braking, and acceleration (actions).
• To learn how to generate correct actions from observations (policy tuning), agent
repeatedly tries to park vehicle using a trial-and-error process.
• Reward signal can be provided to evaluate goodness of a trial and to guide learning
process.
