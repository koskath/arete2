# Slide 20 of Lecture 14 contains information about the Reinforcement Learning (RL).

• Goal: To find most suitable action model to maximize total cumulative reward (for RL
agent).
• With no training dataset, RL problem is solved by agent’s own actions with input
from the environment.
• No need for data collection, preprocessing, and labeling before training.
• Given right incentive, a RL model can start learning a behavior on its own, without
(human) supervision.
• Incentive is either negative (punishment) or positive (reward).
