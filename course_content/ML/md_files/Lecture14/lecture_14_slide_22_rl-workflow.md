# Slide 22 of Lecture 14 contains information about the RL Workflow.

• Environment: Define environment where agent operates (interface between agent
and environment)
• Options: Model simulation, real physical system.
• Reward Definition: Specify reward signal to measure its performance against goals
and how this signal is calculated from the environment
• Reward shaping is tricky and require iterations to get it right.
