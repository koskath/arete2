# Slide 6 of Lecture 12 contains information about the Autoencoder.

• Autoencoder has same architecture as MLP except number of neurons in
output layer must be equal to number of inputs.
• Here is single hidden layer composed
of two neurons (encoder).
• One output layer composed of three
neurons (decoder).
• Outputs are often called
reconstructions because autoencoder
tries to reconstruct inputs
