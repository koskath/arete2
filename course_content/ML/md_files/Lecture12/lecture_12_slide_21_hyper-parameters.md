# Slide 21 of Lecture 12 contains information about the Hyper-parameters.

• How should candidate hyperparameters be selected for testing? --> Grid search
• All combinations of selected values of hyperparameters are tested to determine optimal
choice.
• Number of points in grid increases exponentially with number of hyperparameters.
• Ex- 5 hyperparameters, and test 10 values for each hyperparameter, training
procedure needs to be executed 105 = 100000 times to test its accuracy.
• Grid-based hyperparameter exploration is NOT best choice.
