# Slide 5 of Lecture 12 contains information about the Autoencoder.

• Codings are byproducts of autoencoder learning identity function under some
constraints.
• An autoencoder looks at inputs, converts them to an efficient latent representation, and
then output something that (hopefully) looks very close to inputs.
• E.g.,: you can add noise to inputs and train network to recover original inputs.
• Autoencoder composed of two parts:
• An encoder (or recognition network) that converts inputs to a latent representation.
• A decoder (or generative network) that converts internal representation to outputs.
