# Slide 4 of Lecture 12 contains information about the Autoencoder.

• Autoencoders are:
• unsupervised (self-supervised learning)
• generative models: capable of randomly generating new data that looks very similar
to training data.
• ANNs capable of learning dense representations of input data, called latent
representations or codings.
• Codings typically have a much lower dimensionality than input data.
• Autoencoders useful for dimensionality reduction good for visualization purposes.
• Autoencoders simply learn to copy their inputs to their outputs.
