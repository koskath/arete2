# Slide 17 of Lecture 8 contains information about the Variance.

"Confusion" is captured by a kind of variance of gradients. When variance equals 0, every step goes in the right direction, which is outside of the confusion region. When variance is small, we are just inside the region of confusion. When variance is large, many steps will point in the wrong direction.
