# Slide 8 of Lecture 9 contains information about the From Biological to Artificial Neurons.

• First introduced* in 1943 by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts.
• First ANN: To show of how biological neurons might work together in animal brains to
perform complex computations using propositional logic.
• “Dendrites” takes input signal.
• “Axon” sends an output signal.
