# Slide 23 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Perceptron.

• Single TLU can be used for simple linear binary classification.
• Perceptron is composed of a single layer of TLUs.
• Each TLU connected to all inputs.
• TLU computes a linear combination of inputs.
• If result exceeds a threshold, it outputs positive class.
• Fully connected /dense layer: All neurons in a layer connected to every
neuron in previous layer.
• An extra bias feature is generally added (x = 1):
0
• Typically represented using a special type of neuron called a bias neuron.
• Outputs 1 always.
