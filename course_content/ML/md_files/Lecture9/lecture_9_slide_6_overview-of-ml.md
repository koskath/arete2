# Slide 6 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Overview of ML.

• Components: Data, Model, Objective Function, Optimization Algorithm.
• Data: Input and output data
• Common way of describing an input dataset is with a design matrix.
• Issues: underfitting, overfitting, training error and test error.
• Model: To generate output.
• Parametric models (linear regression)
• Non-parametric models.
• Objective function: Real valued function that provides a measure of how
wrong model is in terms of its ability to estimate relationship between inputs
and outputs.
