# Slide 37 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Sigmoid Function.

• Logistic (noted σ(·)) is a sigmoid function (i.e., S-shaped) that outputs between 0 and 1
(remember Estimating Probabilities by Logistic Regression).
• Sigmoid function is a type of activation function (or squashing function).
• Squashing functions limit output to a range between 0 and 1.
• An activation function determines output behaviour of each node, or “neuron” in an ANN.
• Used in testing of ANNs.
