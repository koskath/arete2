# Slide 22 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Perceptron.

• Simplest ANN architectures.
• Invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt.
• Based on a slightly different artificial neuron called a threshold logic unit
(TLU), or linear threshold unit (LTU).
• Inputs and output are numbers, and each input connection is associated with
a weight.
• TLU computes a weighted sum of its inputs, then applies a step function to
that sum and outputs result.
