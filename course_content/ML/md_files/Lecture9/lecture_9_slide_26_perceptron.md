# Slide 26 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Perceptron.

• Perceptron incapable of learning complex patterns:
• Because decision boundary of each output neuron is linear (just like Logistic Regression
classifiers).
• Logistic Regression Vs Perceptrons:
• Perceptrons do not output a class probability.
• Perceptrons make predictions based on a hard threshold.
• Weaknesses:
• Incapable of solving Exclusive OR (XOR) classification problem
• Soln: Can be solved by stacking multiple Perceptrons
• Resulting ANN is called a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
