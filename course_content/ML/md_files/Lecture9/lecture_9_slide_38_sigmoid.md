# Slide 38 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Sigmoid.

• Consider setting ‘h’ to define binary features z using:
i
• Each h(z ) can be viewed as binary feature.
i
• We can make 2k objects by all the possible “part combinations”.
• Hard to optimize (non-differentiable/discontinuous).
• Sigmoid is a smooth approximation to these binary features.
