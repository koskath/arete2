# Slide 38 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Sigmoid.

Consider setting 'h' to define binary features z. Each h(z ) can be viewed as a binary feature. We can make 2k objects by all the possible "part combinations". However, this is hard to optimize because it is non-differentiable or discontinuous. The Sigmoid is a smooth approximation to these binary features.
