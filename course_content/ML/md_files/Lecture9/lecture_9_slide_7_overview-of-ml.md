# Slide 7 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Overview of ML.

• Objective function: real values function that provides a measure of how wrong the
model is in terms of its ability to estimate the relationship between inputs and outputs.
• Mean square error function, cross-entropy function (classification problems),
Maximum Likelihood estimation.
• Optimization Algorithm: Minimizes or maximizes function f (x) by altering x.
• Gradient descent: reduce f(x) by moving x in opposite sign of derivative.
