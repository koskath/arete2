# Slide 4 of Lecture 9 contains information about the ML and Deep Learning History.

• 1950 and 1960s: Initial excitement.
• Perceptron: linear classifier and stochastic gradient (roughly).
• Drop in popularity: Realized limitations of linear models.
• 1970 and 1980s: Connectionism (brain-inspired ML)
• Want “connected networks of simple units”.
• Adding hidden layers z increases expressive power.

• Success in optical character recognition.
• 1990s and early-2000s: drop in popularity.
• Rise in popularity of logistic regression and SVMs with regularization and kernels.
