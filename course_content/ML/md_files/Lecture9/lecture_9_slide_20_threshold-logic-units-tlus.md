# Slide 20 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Threshold Logic Units (TLUs).

• TLU is a processing unit for numbers with n inputs x ,...,x and one output y.
1 n
• Unit has a threshold θ and each input x is associated with a weight w .
i i
• Threshold logic unit computes the function.
• TLUs mimic thresholding behaviour of biological neurons in a (very) simple fashion.
