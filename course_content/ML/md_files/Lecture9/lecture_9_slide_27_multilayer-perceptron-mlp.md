# Slide 27 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Multilayer Perceptron: MLP.

• MLP is composed of one input layer, one or more layers of TLUs, called hidden layers*, and
a layer of TLU called output layer.
• Layers close to input layer are called lower layers
• Layers close to outputs are called upper layers.
• Every input/hidden layer includes a bias neuron and is fully connected to next layer.

of 4-neurons, and 3-output neurons

*Whenan ANN contains a deep stack of hidden layers it is called a deepneural network (DNN).
