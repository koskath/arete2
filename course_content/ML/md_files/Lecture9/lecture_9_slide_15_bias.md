# Slide 15 of Lecture 9 contains information about the Bias.

• Generalization error consists of three different errors: Bias, Variance,
Irreducible error (due to noisiness of data).
• Bias happen due to wrong assumptions.
• High-bias model is most likely to underfit the training data.
• Example: Assuming data is linear when it is quadratic.
• Note: If you trains a linear SVM model using the LinearSVC class (of Sci-kit).
• LinearSVC class regularizes bias term.
