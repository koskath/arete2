# Slide 13 of Lecture 11 contains information about the Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM).

• Bidirectional LSTM a type of RNN
• Built to improve unidirectional LSTM.
• Designed for speech recognition.
• Combines outputs from side-by-side networks to predict next time step of a
sequence having both past and future related information.
• Usage Scenarios
• When a coherent set of information is present (learning problems).
• Works well for sequence prediction.
