# Slide 14 of Lecture 11 contains information about the Bi-LSTM.

• Forward LSTM: ​Involves placing
RN layers beside each other
where one layer works to learn
long-term dependencies from
past.
• Backward LSTM​: Input is reversed
and fed into the network;
network learns long-term
dependencies from future.​
