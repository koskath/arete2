# Slide 4 of Lecture 11 contains information about the Long Short-Term Memory (or LSTM).

• LSTM is a RNN variant.
• More complicated memory cell than RNN.
• Proposed in 1997 by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber*.
• Contain gates to control information flow within recurrent cell.
• Efficient for capturing long-term dependencies across many time instants.
• Can be used for faster training, long-term data dependency detection.
• Components of LSTM: Memory cell, Input gate, Forget gate, Output gate.
• Applications: Image captioning, stock market prediction, machine translation,
and text classification (for sequence processing).
