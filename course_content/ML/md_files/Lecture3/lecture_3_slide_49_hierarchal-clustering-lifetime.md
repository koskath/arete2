# Slide 49 of Lecture 3 contains information about the Hierarchal Clustering: Lifetime.

Lifetime refers to the distance between a cluster’s creation and the point at which it disappears by merging with another cluster; for example, clusters A, B, C, D, E, and F have lifetimes of 0.71, 0.71, 1.41, 0.50, 1.00, and 0.50 respectively, so the lifetime of (A, B) is (2.50 - 0.71 = 1.79).
