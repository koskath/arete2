# Slide 48 of Lecture 3 contains information about the Hierarchal Clustering.

Subsequent merges combine E with (D, F) at distance 1.00, then that cluster with C at distance 1.41, and finally the resulting (((D, F), E), C) cluster with (A, B) at distance 2.50, yielding a final cluster containing all objects and concluding the computation.
