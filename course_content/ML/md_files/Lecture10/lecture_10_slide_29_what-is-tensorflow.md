# Slide 29 of Lecture 10 contains information about the What is TensorFlow?.

Its core is very similar to NumPy, but with GPU support.
•
Key idea: express a numeric computation as a graph.
•
Graph nodes are operations with any number of inputs and outputs.
•
Graph edges are tensors which flow between nodes.
•
Computation graphs can be exported to a portable format, train here- run there.
•
Core features: tf.keras, data loading and preprocessing (tf.data, tf.io), image processing
•
(tf.image), signal processing (tf.signal)
