# Slide 20 of Lecture 10 contains information about the Model Training.

•
Steps: 1) build a computational graph from network definition, 2) input training data and
compute loss function, 3) update parameters.
•
Define-and-run: DL frameworks complete step one in advance of step two (TensorFlow,
Caffe).
•
Define-by-run: Combines steps one and two into a single step (PyTorch).
•
Computational graph is not given before training but obtained while training.
