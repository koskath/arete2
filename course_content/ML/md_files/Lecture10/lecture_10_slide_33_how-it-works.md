# Slide 33 of Lecture 10 contains information about the How it works?.

• MatMul: Multiply two matrices
• Add: Add element wise
• ReLU: Activate with elementwise rectified linear
function
0, x <= 0
ReLu(x) =
x, x > 0
• Variables are stateful nodes which output their
current value.
• State is retained across multiple executions of
a graph (mostly parameters).
