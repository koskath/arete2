# Slide 11 of Lecture 10 contains information about the Recurrent Connection Schemes.

• Two main schemes for forming recurrent connections from one recurrent layer to another:
• Recurrent connections between hidden units.
• Better captures high-dimensional features about past.
• Recurrent connections between output of previous layer and hidden unit.
• Easy to compute and parallelizable.
