# Slide 30 of Lecture 10 contains information about the What is TensorFlow?.

TensorFlow’s API revolves around tensors which flow from operation to
•
operation hence name TensorFlow.
Tensor is like a NumPy ndarray
•
Can create a tensor from a NumPy array and vice versa.
•
• Can apply TensorFlow operations to NumPy arrays and NumPy operations
to tensors.
Ideally a multi-dimensional array but can hold a scalar.
•
Helps during custom cost functions, custom metrics, custom layers.
