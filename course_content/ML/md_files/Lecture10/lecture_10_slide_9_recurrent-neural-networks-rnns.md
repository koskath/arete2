# Slide 9 of Lecture 10 contains information about the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

• Recurrent Computational Graph: RNN formalized as an unfolded computational
graph.
• An unfolded computational graph shows information flow through recurrent layer at
every time instant in the sequence.
A sequence of five-time steps: We will
unfold recurrent neuron five-times across number of
instants.​
