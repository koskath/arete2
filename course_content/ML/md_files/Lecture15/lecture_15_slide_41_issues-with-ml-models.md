# Slide 41 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Issues with ML models.

• Adversarial learning is a technique employed to attempt to fool machine learning by
automatically crafting adversarial examples.
• Interpretability: Model is given an input X and it produces an output Y through a
sequence of operations hardly understandable to a human.
• Interpretability of the model determines how easily the analysts can manage and
assess the quality and correct the operation of a given model.
• Example: Cybersecurity analysts prefer rule-based and signature-based
systems rather than neural-based methods
