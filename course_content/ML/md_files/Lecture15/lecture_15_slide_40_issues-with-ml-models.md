# Slide 40 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Issues with ML models.

• Class imbalance: Disproportional number of samples per class.
• Classifier might be biased towards majority classes and achieve bad
classification.
• Concept drift: describe problem of changing underlying relationships in data.
• Approximating a mapping function (f) given input data (x) to predict an
output value (y), y = f(x).
• Digit classification, text categorization or speech recognition, assume
that mapping learning from historical data will be valid for new data and
relationships between input and output do not change over time. Not true for
the problem of malware detection and classification.
