# Slide 35 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Robustness of DNN.

• Robustness determines the integrity of the network under varying operating
conditions, and the accuracy of DNN outputs in the presence/absence of input or
network alterations.
• Divided into two security and reliability.
1. If attacker cannot steal information, engage system resources, modify network
parameters, or render an incorrect input.
2. If it does not display any changes to its output, parameters, or behavior, due
to changes in environmental conditions, during fabrication and deployment.
