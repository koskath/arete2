# Slide 33 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Neural Networks.

• If input propagates through the network in only one direction -> feedforward network.
• If there are feedback loops in the network -> Recurrent NN.
• LSTMs retains information for long duration, well suited for time-series prediction.
• First generation of NNs: single-layer NNs and MLPs
• Second generation of NNs: To reduce number of parameters in a network, introduces
convolutional NNs (CNNs).
• To solve problem of information loss in CNNs use capsule networks (CapsNets).
• Third generation of NNs: Makes use of spiking NNs (SNNs) to emulate human brain-like
functioning.
