# Slide 38 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Linear programming.

• LP-based verification works by defining the system as a set of linear constraints, and
property to be verified as an objective function.
• Objective function can be either a minimization or a maximization function.
• DNN verification: LP is used to check robustness of network against adversarial
attacks.
• Limitation of LP: Requires linear constraints.
