# Slide 48 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Recap(3/3).

• Formal verification methods like SAT, LP, and SMT are used for robust ML.
• Issues with ML models include class imbalance, concept drift, adversarial learning, and a lack
of interpretability.
• Handling ML experiments involves tracking model creation details, hyperparameters, feature
transformations, and datasets used.
• Model management challenges include defining the model, validation, retraining, and
ensuring backwards compatibility.
• Data management challenges involve data integration, feature transformation, and querying
model metadata.
