# Slide 37 of Lecture 15 contains information about the SAT/SMT.

• SAT is a branch of formal verification.
• System model and property to be verified for the system are expressed in a
propositional logic, and written into conjunctive normal form (CNF).
• Formula is then checked by an automatic SAT solver.
• SAT-based verification suffers from scalability problem.
• SMT solvers are preferred for verifying DNNs with real and/or integer network
parameters.
