# Slide 31 of Lecture 15 contains information about the OpenAI's AI alignment.

• OpenAI’s superalignment project is focused on aligning artificial superintelligence
systems.
• Focuses on engineering a scalable training signal for smart AI systems that is
aligned with human intent. It has three main pillars:
1. Training AI systems using human feedback.
• RL from human feedback: InstructGPT[1]
• Training AI systems to assist human evaluation.
2. Training AI systems to do alignment research.
