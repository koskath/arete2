• Ethical issues in AI are a key concern.
• AI alignment is the process of encoding human values and goals into LLMs to make them
helpful, safe, and reliable.
• Goal of AI alignment is to enable enterprises to tailor AI models to follow their business rules
and policies. Alignment happens during fine-tuning, involving instruction-tuning and a critique
phase.
• Importance of AI alignment stems from the increasing impact and risks of Deep Learning (DL)
applications, with misalignment being a significant source of these risks.
• Misalignment has two main causes: reward hacking, where proxy rewards are optimized
instead of actual rewards, and goal misgeneralization, where the agent pursues objectives
different from training objectives.
