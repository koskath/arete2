# Slide 30 of Lecture 15 contains information about the Alignment Cycle.

• Forward Alignment (training) produces
trained systems based on alignment
requirements.
• Backward Alignment (refinement) ensures
practical alignment of trained systems and
revises alignment requirements
• Ensure practical alignment
of trained systems.
• Cycle is repeated until reaching a
sufficient level of alignment.
