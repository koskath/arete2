# Slide 9 of Lecture 13 contains information about the CNN Components.

• Convolution layer is made up of filters and feature maps.
• Filter [or Kernel] is passed over input image pixels to capture a specific set of features
in a process called convolution.
• Convolution is the process by which a function is applied to a matrix
to extract specific information from the matrix.
• Feature maps are outputs of a filter in a convolutional layer.
Receptive Field is
an area of the input
image that CNN
neuron "sees"
