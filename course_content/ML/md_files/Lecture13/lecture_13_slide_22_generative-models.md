# Slide 22 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Generative Models.

• Generative models learn a mapping from random noise vectors to
things that look like, e.g., images.
• Need to have some criterion for evaluating image quality, then compute
gradient wrt to parameters,
• Update parameters for better image.
