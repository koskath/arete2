# Slide 33 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

•
Idea: Let NNs to compete against each other to perform better.
•
GAN composed of two neural networks with different objectives
•
Generator: Takes a random distribution as input (typically Gaussian) and outputs some
data typically, an image.
•
Discriminator: Takes either a fake image from generator or a real image from training
set as input and guess whether input image is fake or real.
