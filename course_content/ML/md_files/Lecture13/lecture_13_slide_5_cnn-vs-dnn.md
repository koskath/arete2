# Slide 5 of Lecture 13 contains information about the CNN VS DNN.

• CNNs Layers are designed to process grid-like data. It include convolutional layers
that apply filters to the input data to detect features like edges, textures, and patterns.
• Fewer parameters
• Less overfits
• Automatically learns spatial features from images
• Locally connected network
• Applications: Image and video recognition
• DNNs includes any neural network with multiple layers. It consists of fully connected
layers where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.
• More parameters
• Overfits
• Require feature engineering
• Fully connected
• Applications: Used for a wide range of tasks.
