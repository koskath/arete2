# Slide 8 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

An image can be described as a matrix of pixel intensity values between 0 and 255, and in the grayscale case there is just one channel, with 0 representing black, 255 representing white, and intermediate values encoding the various shades. A simple 10×10 grayscale image therefore maps directly onto a 10×10 matrix of intensities, reinforcing the 2-D representation.
