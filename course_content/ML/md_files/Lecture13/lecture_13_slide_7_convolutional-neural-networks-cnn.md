# Slide 7 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

• Coloured image consists red, green, and
blue with pixel intensity values from 0 to
255.
• A coloured image has a matrix shape of
[height x width x channel].
• Side image of shape [10 x 10 x 3] indicating
a 10 x 10 matrix with three channels.
• NN perform image processing on multi-
channelled images.
• Each channel represents a color.
• Each pixel consists of three channels -
RGB
• RGB image can be described as a wxhxn_c
matrix, where w, h, and n_c denote width,
height, and number of channels
respectively.
