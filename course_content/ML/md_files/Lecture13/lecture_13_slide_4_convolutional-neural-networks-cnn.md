# Slide 4 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

• CNNs emerged from the study of the brain’s visual cortex.
• Popular use image recognition (since 1980s).
• Deep neural network does NOT work well for large mage recognition..?
• For example, a 100×100 pixel image has 10,000 pixels. If the first layer has just 1,000
neurons means a total of 10M connections for just the first layer.
• CNNs solve it using partially connected layers and weight sharing.
• CNN each layer is represented in 2D which makes it easier to match neurons with their
corresponding inputs.
