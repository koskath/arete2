# Slide 6 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

• Convolution is a mathematical operation that slides one function over another and
measures the integral of their pointwise multiplication.
• It has deep connections with Fourier transform + Laplace transform.
• Convolutional layers use cross-correlations (similar to convolutions).
• CNN has three fundamental layers: Convolutional layer, Pooling layer, Fully connected
layer.
• Convolutional layer is the most important building block of a CNN.
• During training convolutional layers require a huge amount of RAM.
