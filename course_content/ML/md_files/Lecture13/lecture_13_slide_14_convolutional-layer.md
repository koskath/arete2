# Slide 14 of Lecture 13 contains information about the Convolutional Layer.

• Neuron’s weights can be represented as a small image size of receptive field.
• Feature map highlights areas in an image that activate filter (or convolution kernels)
most.
• All neurons in a feature map share same parameters which dramatically reduces number
of parameters in model.
• Once CNN has learned to recognize a pattern in one location, it can recognize it in any
other location.
• DNN can recognize only at particular location.
