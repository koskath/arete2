# Slide 15 of Lecture 13 contains information about the CNN Components.

• Fully Connected Network (FCN) layer is feedforward neural network or multilayer
perceptron (MLP).
• These layers typically have a non-linear activation function (softmax).
• FCN is the final layer of CNN.
• CNN Modeling:
• First layer following input layer of images must be a convolutional layer for
extracting image features.
• Pooling layers typical follow a set of one or more convolutional layers.
