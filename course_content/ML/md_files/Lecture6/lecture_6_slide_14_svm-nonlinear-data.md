# Slide 14 of Lecture 6 contains information about the SVM: Nonlinear Data.

For nonlinear data, you can add a new dimension z defined by the rule z = x^2 + y^2, turning a circular decision boundary of radius 1 in the original 2D space into a plane parallel to the x-axis at z = 1 in 3D, where SVM can then find a linear hyperplane that cleanly separates the two linearly separable groups.
