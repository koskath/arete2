# Slide 13 of Lecture 6 contains information about the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Consider a dataset of red and blue points with two features, x and y; SVM takes these data points from both classes and outputs a separating hyperplane (a line in 2D) that serves as the decision boundary, and we seek a classifier that, given a pair of (x, y) coordinates, predicts whether the point is red or blue, recognizing that not all separating hyperplanes are equally good because SVM prefers the one that maximizes the margin between classes.
