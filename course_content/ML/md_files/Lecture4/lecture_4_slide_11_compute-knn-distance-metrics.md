# Slide 11 of Lecture 4 contains information about the Compute KNN: Distance Metrics.

The goal when computing KNN is to identify the nearest neighbors of a given query point so that we can assign an appropriate class label, which requires choosing a distance metric—most commonly Euclidean or Manhattan distance—that measures absolute differences between points and is defined for real-valued vectors.
