The image contains a mathematical expression:

- The expression begins with "f(u, W)" on the left.
- It is followed by an equals sign "=".
- There is a fraction "1/2".
- A summation symbol "∑" follows, with the limits "i=1" at the bottom and "n" at the top.
- Inside the summation, the expression "(v^T h(Wx_i) - y_i)^2" appears.
  - The term "v^T" includes a superscript "T".
  - "h(Wx_i)" has arguments "W" and "x_i", with "_i" being a subscript.
  - The subtraction is done with "y_i", where "_i" is subscripted.
  - The entire difference "(v^T h(Wx_i) - y_i)" is squared, denoted by "^2".

The elements are written in a compact and sequential manner, with mathematical symbols and notation clearly specifying the operations and hierarchy.
