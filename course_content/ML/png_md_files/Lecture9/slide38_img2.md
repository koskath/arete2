The image contains a mathematical piecewise function written in a handwritten style.

On the left side, the function is denoted as:
\( h(z_{ic}) = \)

To the right of the equals sign, a large curly brace opens to encompass two conditions:
1. The top condition reads as:
   - "1" followed by "if" with a space in between. 
   - The condition specifies \( z_{ic} \geq 0 \), where the "greater than or equal to" symbol is represented by \( \geq \).

2. The bottom condition reads as:
   - "0" followed by "if" with a space in between.
   - The condition specifies \( z_{ic} < 0 \).

The piecewise function is structured vertically, with "1" and "0" aligned one above the other, each followed by their respective conditions. The entire expression is written using a fluid, cursive-like style.
