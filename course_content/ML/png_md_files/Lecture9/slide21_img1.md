The image is split into two sections: a diagram on the left and a table on the right.

### Diagram (Left):
- There are three key components: two arrows on the left and one circle connected to an arrow on the right.
- The left side has two arrows pointing towards a circle in the center. The top arrow is labeled "3" and originates from a label "x₁," while the bottom arrow is labeled "2" and originates from a label "x₂."
- Both arrows point towards the center of a circle. Inside the circle is the number "4."
- A single arrow extends from the right side of the circle, pointing right, labeled with "y."

### Table (Right):
- The table consists of four columns and five rows, including headers.
- The headers from left to right are "x₁," "x₂," "3x₁ + 2x₂," and "y."
- Row 1: (headers) x₁, x₂, 3x₁ + 2x₂, y
- Row 2: All columns contain "0."
- Row 3: The values are "1," "0," "3," "0" in sequence.
- Row 4: The values are "0," "1," "2," "0" in sequence.
- Row 5: The values are "1," "1," "5," "1" in sequence.
- The table is enclosed by lines, with vertical lines separating the columns.

The diagram and table are side by side, with the diagram occupying the left half and the table occupying the right half of the image. The elements are well-organized, with a clear representation of inputs, weighted sums, and outputs in both the diagram and table.
