The image is a timeline chart illustrating key developments in neural network history. Along a horizontal axis marked with decades from 1940 to 2020, several vertical lines extend upward, each labeled with a significant term or event in neural network development. Left to right, the vertical lines and their labels are:

1. **1940** - "McCulloch/Pitts Neurons" with a line extending up.
2. **1950** - "Hebbs Organization of Behavior" with a line extending shorter than the one before.
3. **1960** - "Rosenblatts Perceptron" in bold, with a line extending up.
4. **1960** - "Multi-Layer Perceptrons" in bold, with a line extending up parallel to the previous line.
5. **1980** - "Backpropagation" in bold, with a line extending up.
6. **1980** - "Hopfield Networks" with a line higher than the "Backpropagation" line.
7. **1990** - "Convolutional Neural Networks" with a line extending up.
8. **2000** - "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)" with a shorter line compared to previous ones.
9. **2010** - "Deep Learning" with a line extending roughly parallel to the LSTM line.
10. **2010** - "Deep Learning with GPUs" with a line extending up shortly after the "Deep Learning" line.

The timeline is marked at the bottom with vertical divisions, separating each decade from 1940 to 2020. Each label's line connects to the corresponding point on the timeline where the development occurred.
