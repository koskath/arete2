On the left side of the image is a diagram consisting of a circle with two incoming arrows and one outgoing arrow. The circle contains the symbol "-1" at its center. To the left of the circle, two arrows are directed towards it, labeled with numbers and variables. The top arrow is labeled "2" and originates from a point labeled "x₁." The bottom arrow is labeled "−2" and starts from a point labeled "x₂." An outgoing arrow on the right side of the circle is labeled "y."

On the right side of the image is a table with four columns and five rows, including the header row. The column headers are "x₁," "x₂," "2x₁−2x₂," and "y." 

- The first data row shows values: 0 for "x₁," 0 for "x₂," 0 for "2x₁−2x₂," and 1 for "y."
- The second data row shows values: 1 for "x₁," 0 for "x₂," 2 for "2x₁−2x₂," and 1 for "y."
- The third data row shows values: 0 for "x₁," 1 for "x₂," −2 for "2x₁−2x₂," and 0 for "y."
- The fourth data row shows values: 1 for "x₁," 1 for "x₂," 0 for "2x₁−2x₂," and 1 for "y."

The table is enclosed in a rectangular grid with horizontal and vertical lines separating the headers and data into individual cells.
