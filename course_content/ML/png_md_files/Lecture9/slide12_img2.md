The image contains a mathematical expression written in blue ink, as follows:

- The left side of the equation starts with "ŷᵢ", where "ŷ" has a circumflex accent (a hat) on top, and it is subscripted by "i".
- An equals sign "=" follows.
- On the right side of the equals sign is "w" with a superscript capital "T", forming "wᵀ". 
- This is followed by an opening parenthesis "(".
- Inside the parenthesis is a large capital Greek letter "Π" (Pi) with two subscripts and superscripts directly above and below. 
- Below "Π" is "ℓ = 1", and above "Π" is "m".
- Following the "Π", there is a function "h".
- The argument of the function "h" is enclosed in a separate set of parentheses.
- Inside this set of parentheses, there is another "W", which is superscripted by "(ℓ)".
- After "W^(ℓ)", there is "x", which is subscripted with an "i", written as "xᵢ".
- The expression concludes with a closing parenthesis ")".

The formula is structured linearly and evenly spaced, with all elements aligned horizontally.
