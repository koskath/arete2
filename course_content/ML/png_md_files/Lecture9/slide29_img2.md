The image depicts a diagram featuring a circle in the center. Inside the circle is the expression "f(x, y)". 

Two arrows point towards the circle from the left side:
1. The upper arrow is labeled "x" and points towards the left side of the circle.
2. The lower arrow is labeled "y" and also points towards the left side of the circle.

An arrow extends from the right side of the circle, pointing to the right, and is labeled "z". 

The circle and arrows suggest a function or process where inputs "x" and "y" are transformed to produce an output "z". The arrows are straight and have arrowheads indicating direction towards or away from the circle.
