The image contains a mathematical expression for the Manhattan Distance. The text is centered on a light gray background. 

On the left, it begins with the phrase "Manhattan Distance =", followed by the function notation "d(x,y) =", both in a sans-serif font. 

To the right of the equal sign, there is a summation formula enclosed in parentheses:

1. The left parenthesis is followed by a large summation symbol (∑).
2. Positioned above the summation symbol is "m", indicating the upper limit of the summation.
3. Positioned below the summation symbol is "i = 1", indicating the lower limit.
4. To the right of the summation symbol is the expression "|x_i - y_i|", where:
   - "x_i" and "y_i" are variables, each with a subscript "i".
   - The expression is enclosed in vertical bars, denoting absolute value.
5. The formula ends with a right parenthesis.
