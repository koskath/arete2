The image contains a mathematical formula centered on the page against a light gray background. This formula represents the Euclidean distance between two points and is expressed as:

\[ d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - x_i)^2} \]

Details of the formula:

1. The formula begins with the lowercase letter "d" followed by parentheses containing "x, y", indicating the function \( d(x, y) \).
2. There is an equal sign "=", which separates the function from the mathematical expression.
3. The main expression is a square root symbol that extends over the summation.
4. Inside the square root, there is a summation symbol "∑".
5. The summation index is denoted as "i", with the lower limit specified as "i=1" directly under the summation symbol, and the upper limit specified as "n" above it.
6. Adjacent to the summation symbol is the term \((y_i - x_i)^2\), which indicates the difference between \(y_i\) and \(x_i\) squared.

The formula is neatly typeset, with all mathematical symbols and indices clearly displayed.
