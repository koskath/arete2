The image contains two mathematical expressions, each on separate lines. 

1. The first line reads: 
   - "Logit(pi) = 1/(1 + exp(-pi))"
   - The equation represents the logistic function. 
   - The term "Logit(pi)" is to the left of the equal sign "=".
   - To the right of the equal sign, the equation consists of the fraction "1/(1 + exp(-pi))" where:
     - The numerator is the number "1".
     - The denominator is the expression "(1 + exp(-pi))".
     - Inside the parentheses is "1 + exp(-pi)".
     - "exp(-pi)" represents the exponential function of "-pi".

2. The second line reads:
   - "ln(pi/(1-pi)) = Beta_0 + Beta_1*X_1 + ... + B_k*K_k"
   - The left-hand side of the equation is "ln(pi/(1-pi))".
   - "ln" represents the natural logarithm.
   - The expression inside the parentheses is "pi/(1-pi)".
   - To the right of the equal sign, the expression is a linear combination:
     - "Beta_0" is the first term.
     - "+ Beta_1*X_1" is the second term with "Beta_1" multiplied by "X_1".
     - "+ ..." indicates continuation of similar terms.
     - "+ B_k*K_k" is the last visible term with "B_k" multiplied by "K_k".

The expressions are aligned horizontally and are written in a clear, consistent font style.
