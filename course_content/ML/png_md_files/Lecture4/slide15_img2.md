The image consists of three scatter plots arranged in a 2x2 grid format. Each plot is accompanied by annotations marking the stages of a classification process involving two classes, indicated by different colored shapes: red stars and green triangles.

**Top Left Plot: "Initial Data"**
- **Axes**: X-Axis and Y-Axis, both with arrowheads pointing right and up respectively.
- **Data Points**: 
  - Red stars clustered toward the upper-left region, labeled as "Class A."
  - Green triangles scattered toward the lower-right region, labeled as "Class B."
  - A yellow rectangle with a question mark inside ("?") is located near the boundary of star and triangle clusters. It is labeled as "New example to classify" and has a black arrow pointing to it.
  
**Top Right Plot: "Calculate Distance"**
- **Axes**: X-Axis and Y-Axis, both with arrowheads.
- **Data Points**: 
  - Same distribution of red stars and green triangles as in the first plot.
  - Yellow rectangle with a question mark positioned similarly.
  - Dashed lines connecting the yellow rectangle to the nearest star and triangle, indicating distance calculations.

**Bottom Plot: "Finding Neighbors & Voting for Labels"**
- **Axes**: X-Axis and Y-Axis, both with arrowheads.
- **Data Points**: 
  - Consistent arrangement of red stars and green triangles.
  - Yellow rectangle with question mark located identically.
  - A dashed circle with a center approximately at the yellow rectangle encompasses three data points indicating "k=3."
  - The circle encloses two red stars and one green triangle, showing the nearest neighbors for classification.

**Annotations**: 
- Top-center titles for each plot indicate the steps: "Initial Data," "Calculate Distance," and "Finding Neighbors & Voting for Labels."
- Legends in the top-right corner of each plot define the two classes: "Class A" in red and "Class B" in green.
