The image contains a mathematical formula describing the Minkowski Distance. On the left side, the text "Minkowski Distance" is written in a sans-serif font. To the right of this text, there is an equal sign, followed by a large pair of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, there is a summation symbol (the Greek capital letter sigma, Σ) with the index "i=1" written directly beneath it and the upper limit of summation, "n," written above the sigma. Next to the summation symbol, there is an expression consisting of absolute value bars "| |" enclosing "x subscript i minus y subscript i" (|x_i - y_i|). The entire expression inside the summation is raised to the "1/p" power, which is written as a superscript outside and to the right of the closing parenthesis.
