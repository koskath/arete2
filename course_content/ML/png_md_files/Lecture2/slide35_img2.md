The image displays a mathematical formulation related to recall, also known as the true positive rate (TPR). It is structured as follows:

1. "Recall (or TPR)" is written on the left side of the equation.

2. An equality symbol "=" follows "Recall (or TPR)."

3. To the right of the equality symbol, a fraction is presented with:
   - The numerator reading "correctly classified actual positives."
   - The denominator reading "all actual positives."
   The fraction visually conveys the definition of recall.

4. Another equality symbol "=" follows the fraction.

5. To the right of this equality symbol, another fraction is displayed:
   - The numerator contains "TP."
   - The denominator contains "TP + FN."

The entire equation is inline and presented in a mathematical notation style.
