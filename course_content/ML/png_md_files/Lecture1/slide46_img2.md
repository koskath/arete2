The image is a flowchart with various elements connected by arrows, depicting a machine learning process. Here's a detailed description:

1. **Data (Left Section)**
   - A rectangular area labeled "Data" in the bottom left corner.
   - Inside this area, there is a simple plot with coordinate axes.
   - The plot contains six blue dots.

2. **Update Data (Top Center)**
   - A rectangle labeled "Update data."
   - An arrow pointing left from "Update data" connects it to "Launch!".
   - A solid arrow pointing downwards from "Update data" leads to "Train ML algorithm."

3. **Train ML Algorithm (Bottom Center)**
   - A rectangle labeled "Train ML algorithm."
   - Connected upwards to "Update data" via a solid arrow.
   - Connected to "Evaluate solution" towards the right with a solid arrow.

4. **Evaluate Solution (Right Section)**
   - A diamond shape labeled "Evaluate solution" on the right.
   - A smiley face is located above the diamond.
   - An arrow from "Evaluate solution" goes upwards to "Launch!".

5. **Launch! (Top Right)**
   - A rectangle labeled "Launch!".
   - Connected on the left to "Update data" via an arrow.
   - Takes input from "Evaluate solution" via an upward-pointing arrow.

6. **Can be Automated (Central Area)**
   - An oval labeled "Can be automated" placed centrally.
   - Arrows from "Update data" to "Evaluate solution" pass through it but don't connect directly.

7. **Arrows and Connections**
   - A dashed arrow from the bottom of the "Data" rectangle points to "Train ML algorithm."
   - A dashed arrow from the top of the "Data" rectangle points to "Update data."

The diagram indicates processes flow from data acquisition and updating to algorithm training, evaluation, and launching, with potential for automation, depicted by the oval.
