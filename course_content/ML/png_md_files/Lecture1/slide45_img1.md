The image is a flowchart with black outlines and arrows connecting different elements, arranged as follows:

1. A rectangle on the far left, labeled "Study the problem." It has an arrow pointing right towards another rectangle.

2. To the right of the first rectangle is another rectangle filled with a pink color, labeled "Write rules." It has an arrow pointing right to a diamond shape.

3. The diamond shape is labeled "Evaluate." It is positioned to the right of the "Write rules" rectangle.

4. From the "Evaluate" diamond, there is an upward-pointing arrow on the right, leading to a rectangle labeled "Launch!" Next to this upward arrow, to the left, is a smiley face icon (a circle with two dots for eyes and a curved line for a smiling mouth).

5. Below the "Evaluate" diamond, there is a downward-pointing arrow leading to another rectangular box labeled "Analyze errors." Next to this downward arrow, to the right, is a sad face icon (a circle with two dots for eyes and a curved line for a frowning mouth).

6. From the "Analyze errors" rectangle, there is a left-pointing arrow leading back to the "Study the problem" rectangle, completing a loop with the initial process.

The arrows create a flow that circles through the steps: Study the problem -> Write rules -> Evaluate -> Analyze errors -> back to Study the problem. The "Launch!" path branches separately upwards from "Evaluate."
