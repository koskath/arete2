The image is a single-panel comic depicting two stick figures standing next to a large pile of papers labeled "Linear Algebra." 

- **Left Stick Figure**: This figure is standing on the left side of the pile, facing the other figure. A speech bubble originating from this figure contains the text: "THIS is your machine learning system?"
  
- **Right Stick Figure**: This figure is standing slightly to the right of center, holding a stick and poking the pile. This figure has a speech bubble that contains two parts. The first part says: "YUP! YOU POUR THE DATA INTO THIS BIG PILE OF LINEAR ALGEBRA, THEN COLLECT THE ANSWERS ON THE OTHER SIDE." The second part says: "JUST STIR THE PILE UNTIL THEY START LOOKING RIGHT."

- **Pile of Papers**: In the center, there is a large pile of papers with various mathematical equations scattered on it. Symbols visible include "x^2," a summation symbol, matrices, and other algebraic expressions.

- **Signs**: On the left of the pile, there is a sign sticking out labeled "DATA." On the far right side of the pile, there is a container labeled "ANSWERS" slightly tilted with a small percentage of papers around it.

The setting is minimalistic, with ground lines drawn to show orientation but no other background elements.
