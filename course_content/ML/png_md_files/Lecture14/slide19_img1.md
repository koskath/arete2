The image features a simple diagram with two cartoon characters and annotations. On the left, there is a cartoon dog with a brown body and a yellow collar, facing towards the right, labeled as "agent" in lowercase black text above it. The dog appears to be in motion, indicated by curved motion lines near its wagging tail. Beneath it, a grey oval shadow suggests the ground.

On the right is a woman with red hair, wearing a green top, teal blue shirt, yellow pants, and teal shoes. She is smiling broadly and holding a tree branch in her right hand, with three curved lines indicating motion, as if she is about to throw it. Above her, in black lowercase text, is the word "environment."

Between the dog and the woman, there are three horizontal arrows pointing rightwards and leftwards, arranged vertically. The top arrow, labeled "actions," points from left to right from the dog towards the woman. The middle arrow, labeled "rewards," points from right to left from the woman towards the dog. The bottom arrow, labeled "observations," also points from right to left from the woman towards the dog. Each label is in lowercase black text adjacent to its respective arrow. The background is a plain white, providing contrast to the elements in the image.
