The image contains a mathematical formula for RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). The formula is structured as follows:

- On the left side, the large, italicized letters "RMSE" represent the abbreviation for Root Mean Square Error.
- An equal sign "=" follows immediately after "RMSE," connecting it to the subsequent expression on the right.
- The right side features a large square root symbol √ extending over the entire expression beneath it.
- Under the square root symbol, the expression is composed of a fraction and a summation:
  - The numerator of the fraction is the numeral "1."
  - The denominator of the fraction is the italicized letter "N."
- Next to the fraction is a capital Greek letter sigma (Σ), indicating summation.
- Below the sigma is the subscript "j = 1," indicating the starting index of the summation.
- Above the sigma is the superscript "N," indicating the ending index of the summation.
- Enclosed in parentheses to the right of the sigma is the expression "(y_j - \tilde{y}_j)^2":
  - "y_j" represents the true values, with "y" as a lowercase italic letter and "j" as a subscript.
  - A minus sign "-" separates "y_j" from "\tilde{y}_j".
  - "\tilde{y}_j" represents the predicted values, with "y" as a lowercase italic letter, a tilde accent above it, and "j" as a subscript.
  - The entire expression is squared, as indicated by the superscript "2" outside the right parenthesis.

The formula represents the RMSE calculation as the square root of the averaged squared differences between actual values and predicted values over a dataset with N samples.
