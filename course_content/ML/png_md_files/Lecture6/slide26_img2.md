The image contains a mathematical formula representing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 

- The formula begins with "MAE" in italicized capital letters. 
- It is followed by an equal sign "=".
- Next is a fraction with "1" in the numerator and "N" in the denominator, both in italic.
- The fraction is followed by a large summation symbol "∑".
- Above the summation symbol is the letter "N" in italic, indicating the upper limit of the summation.
- Below the summation symbol is "j = 1" in italic, indicating the summation starts from j equals 1.
- To the right of the summation symbol, there is an absolute value expression "|y_j - 𝑦̇_j|".
  - Inside the absolute value bars, "y_j" is in italic, with "j" as a subscript.
  - A minus sign follows, and then "𝑦̇_j" is in italic, with "j" as a subscript and a breve accent over the "𝑦".

All elements in the expression use a consistent italic font.
