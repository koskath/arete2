The image contains the mathematical formula for Mean Squared Error (MSE). It is expressed as:

\[ MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} (y_j - \tilde{y}_j)^2 \]

Details of the formula:

1. **MSE**: Appears at the far left. It is in italicized uppercase lettering.
   
2. **Equal Sign**: The equals sign "=" follows the MSE on the same line.

3. **Fraction**: 
   - Numerator: The number "1" is positioned above the horizontal fraction bar. 
   - Denominator: The uppercase italicized variable "N" is below the fraction bar.

4. **Summation Notation**: Follows the fraction.
   - Greek uppercase sigma symbol "∑" represents the summation.
   - Below the sigma: Subscript "j=1", indicating the index "j" is starting at 1.
   - Above the sigma: Superscript "N" indicates summation up to the upper limit "N".

5. **Expression Inside Summation**:
   - Parentheses "(" and ")" enclose the expression being summed.
   - Inside the parentheses:
     - "y_j": The italicized variable "y" with subscript "j".
     - Minus sign "-" following "y_j".
     - "\(\tilde{y}_j\)": Represents the predicted value, with an italicized "y" topped with a tilde and followed by subscript "j".
   - Squared Term: The expression "(y_j - \(\tilde{y}_j\))" is raised to the power of 2, indicating it is squared.

The arrangement is linear and logically follows from left to right.
