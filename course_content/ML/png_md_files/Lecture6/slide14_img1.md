The image consists of four panels arranged horizontally, each featuring a plot with annotations and descriptive text below.

**First Panel:**
- A 2D scatter plot with axes labeled "x" (horizontal) and "y" (vertical).
- Blue circles clustered centrally and red triangles scattered around periphery.
- Axes intersect at origin marked "0."
- Below the panel, text reads:
  - "Add z dimension"
  - "Rule: z = x² + y²"

**Second Panel:**
- A 2D plot simulating 3D view with "x" (horizontal) and "z" (vertical) axes.
- Blue circles clustered near origin on x-axis; red triangles spread higher on z-axis.
- Text below reads:
  - "Data in two linearly separated groups"

**Third Panel:**
- Similar 2D plot with "x" (horizontal) and "z" (vertical) axes.
- Blue circles remain near origin; red triangles higher on z-axis.
- Bold horizontal line labeled "Best hyperplane" near the bottom.
- Below, text reads:
  - "In 3D, hyperplane is a plane parallel to x axis at a certain z (z = 1)."

**Fourth Panel:**
- A 2D scatter plot, axes labeled "x" (horizontal) and "y" (vertical).
- Blue circles in center, surrounded by circular boundary, labeled "Best hyperplane."
- Red triangles remain outside boundary on periphery.
- Text beneath reads:
  - "Decision boundary is a circumference of radius 1 (separates both tags using SVM)"
