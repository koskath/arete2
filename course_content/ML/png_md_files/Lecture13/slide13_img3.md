The image consists of a layered diagram with three sections. 

**Left Column:**
- Seven cyan circles are vertically aligned and evenly spaced. Each represents an input node. Lines emanate from each circle to connect with nodes in the middle column.

**Middle Column:**
- Four magenta circles are vertically aligned and positioned to the right of the cyan circles. Each magenta circle connects with black arrows to a node in the right column.
- The connections between the cyan and magenta circles are shown as colored arrows with varied hues: red, green, yellow, and blue. The arrows are directed from the cyan circles to the magenta ones.

**Right Column:**
- Three brown circles are vertically aligned and evenly spaced. Each is connected by a black arrow coming from a magenta circle in the middle column. The arrows are directed from the magenta to the brown circles.

**Legend at the Bottom:**
- A small cyan square divided into a grid, labeled "Input Feature Map."
- A multiplication symbol (“*”).
- A small square consisting of four smaller colored squares (red, yellow, green, blue), labeled "Kernel."
- An equals sign ("=").
- A small magenta square, labeled "Conv."
- A horizontal line connecting to a small brown square, labeled "Pool."

**Spatial Relationships:**
- The arrows create a layered network structure where each set of colored connections shows relationships between layers, moving from left to right through the diagram. The black arrows indicate the final process flow from the middle to the right column.
