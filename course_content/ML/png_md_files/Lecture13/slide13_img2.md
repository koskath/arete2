The image illustrates a diagram of a convolutional neural network focusing on the operation of convolution. On the left, there is a 3D representation of a cube in red outline labeled "Feature maps of previous convolutional layer." This cube is an arrangement of several parallel purple rectangles stacked together.

Four black lines extend from different locations on the 3D cube to four circular shapes positioned in a vertical arrangement. These circles are contained within an oval-shaped, pink shaded area. Each circle is a pale yellow color, and the oval area houses all four circles neatly. This section is labeled "Filters (neurons in the convolutional layer)" above, and "Receptive fields" along the diagonal black lines pointing towards circles.

On the right side of the image, another 3D structure similar in design to the one on the left is present. This structure also contains several stacked parallel purple rectangles but are leaner and are directed to the left. It is labeled "Feature maps."

Each of the circles inside the pink oval connects to this right-side structure through another set of black lines, drawn horizontally. Small squares are depicted on each of the purple rectangles within this right-side structure, symbolizing specific outputs or elements of the "Feature maps."

The three main components – the left 3D structure, the central circular structures, and the right 3D structure – are connected linearly through the use of black lines, indicating a flow or transformation process from left to right.
