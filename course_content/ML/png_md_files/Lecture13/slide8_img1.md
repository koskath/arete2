The image depicts a grid overlay on a coat of arms design with a 7x7 pixel annotation below it. The background is light beige, and the grid has evenly spaced horizontal and vertical lines creating squares. At the top of the grid, an arrow points to the right, while on the left side, another arrow points upwards.

Inside the grid, the central focus is a stylized coat of arms. At the top is a red eagle with outstretched wings centered between two quadrants of the grid. Below the eagle is a green and silver wreath. 

Directly beneath this arrangement is a shield bearing a black "Y" shape on a white field, flanked symmetrically by two rearing white horses, each positioned on either side of the shield. The horses face inward toward the shield, appearing alert with manes flowing backward.

At the base of the emblem is a grassy green mound with red flowers. In front of the green base is a golden ribbon with the inscription "UNITY AND FAITH, PEACE AND PROGRESS" in capital letters.

The entire arrangement is symmetrical along the central vertical axis, with elements balanced on either side. The grid overlay does not distort or obscure any part of the emblem but provides a segmentation of the image.
