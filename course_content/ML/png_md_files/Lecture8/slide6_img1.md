The image shows a silhouette of a person hiking on a hill or mountain. The person is oriented towards the right side of the image, walking with the aid of two trekking poles. The figure is wearing a backpack and appears to be moving upward along the rocky terrain of the hill. 

To the right of the hiker, there is an object resembling a stack of rocks, forming a cairn, which slightly juts up into the sky. The sky in the background is overcast with a spread of clouds, suggesting a cloudy day. The scene is set in monochrome, with dark silhouettes against a lighter gray sky, so no colors are visible.

In the bottom left corner, part of a tree is visible, with the rest of the landscape forming a dark slope downwards. The text "Gradient Descent (GD)" is displayed at the top center of the image in black font, set against a white background.
