The image is a graph with two axes. The horizontal axis is labeled "Epochs," and the vertical axis is labeled "Loss." The graph is divided into two sections by a vertical dashed line in the center labeled "early stopping" with an upward pointing arrow below it. The left section is labeled "Underfitting" and the right section is labeled "Overfitting."

Two curves are plotted on the graph:

1. An orange curve labeled "validation" starts higher on the left side of the graph and curves downward in a convex shape before increasing again on the right side.
2. A blue curve labeled "training" begins high on the left side and continuously decreases in a concave shape, flattening out as it reaches the right side of the graph.

The blue "training" curve is positioned below the orange "validation" curve as they both approach the early stopping line. Both curves intersect the vertical axis at their starting points. There are no specific data points, grid lines, or numerical annotations on the axes.
