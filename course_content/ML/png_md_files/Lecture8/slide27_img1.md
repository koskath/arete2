The image contains a mathematical formula representing the quadratic formula. The formula is presented as follows:

- The equation starts with "x =" on the left side.
- Following the equals sign is a large horizontal fraction bar.
- Above the fraction bar (in the numerator), there is: 
  - "-b" written at the start.
  - Next to "-b", there is the plus-minus symbol "±".
  - After the "±" symbol, there is a square root symbol "√".
  - Under the square root symbol is the expression "b² - 4ac".
    - "b²" consists of "b" followed by a superscript "2".
    - "- 4ac" follows "b²", with "4ac" being the product of "4", "a", and "c".
- Below the fraction bar (in the denominator), there is "2a", which represents the multiplication of "2" and "a".

The formula is neatly organized, with the fraction and square root presented clearly, ensuring each component is precisely aligned.
