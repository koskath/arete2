The image contains a graph and an illustration with the following elements:

1. **Title and Annotations:**
   - At the top left, there is a text in bold: “If stops early, never reach global minimum.”
   - Above the graph, the text "Gradient Descent pitfalls" is present.

2. **Graph:**
   - The graph has two axes. The vertical axis is labeled "Cost" with an upward-pointing arrow. The horizontal axis is labeled "θ" with a right-pointing arrow.
   - The curve on the graph is non-convex, displaying multiple peaks and troughs.
   - On the left side, there is a small trough labeled "Local minimum" with a dashed vertical line.
   - Toward the center, there is a deeper trough labeled "Global minimum" with another dashed vertical line.
   - To the right of the global minimum, the curve flattens, and this region is labeled "Plateau."
   - The word "Non-Convex" is written in red beneath the plateau area.

3. **Data Points:**
   - Along the curve, multiple blue circular markers are plotted, suggesting the trajectory of gradient descent.
   - The sequence of blue markers starts from the left, descending into the local minimum, then rises before descending again towards the global minimum, and finally moves across the plateau.

4. **Illustration:**
   - To the right of the graph, there is an illustration of a rugged mountain-like terrain.
   - Three arrows are drawn, pointing downward towards the peaks of the terrain.

The overall image is an indication of the complexities involved in gradient descent for non-convex functions, highlighting local minimums, global minimums, and plateaus.
