Hierarchical clustering information is presented in a bifurcating tree diagram on the right and bullet points on the left. The bullet points state: 

- "Hierarchical clustering:"
  - "Outliers take longer to join other groups."
  - "Also good for outlier groups."

The tree diagram depicts evolutionary relationships. 

- Horizontal lines connect species, indicating divergence times. 
- Numbers above/beside lines represent bootstrap values.

Species are grouped:

- Tree branches in colors:
  - Red: Arctic fox, Kit fox, Corsac fox, Ruppell's fox, Red fox, Cape fox, Blanford's fox, Fennec fox, with images on the right.
  - Green: Raccoon dog, Bat-eared fox, Short-eared dog, Crab-eating fox, with images.
  - Blue: Sechuran fox, Culpeo fox, Pampas fox, Chilla, Darwin's fox, Hoary fox, Maned wolf, Bush dog, Side-striped jackal, Black-backed jackal, Golden jackal, Dog, Grey wolf, Coyote, Ethiopian wolf, Dhole, African wild dog, with images.
  - Orange at lower left: Grey fox, Island fox.

Time divergence markers between branches:

- "9–10 Myr," "6–7.4 Myr," "3–4 Myr."
- "100" appears frequently, possibly indicating reliability or frequency.

Images of animals accompany names. 

Highlighted in a red oval at the bottom:

- Four species: Giant panda, Northern elephant seal, Walrus, Black bear, with Dog silhouette.

Diagram axes are not labeled, and the x-axis represents time without a scale.
