The image displays a user-item matrix labeled "Consider this user-item matrix:" at the top. The matrix is represented as \( X = \), followed by a large curly bracket encompassing a table. The table has six columns and five rows:

Columns:
1. "Product 1"
2. "Product 2"
3. "Product 3"
4. "Product 4"
5. "Product 5"
6. "Product 6"

Rows (users):
1. John
2. Paul
3. George
4. Ringo
5. Yoko

The cells of the matrix contain either "1" or "0" and are distributed as follows:

- "John" row: 
  - Product 1: 1
  - Product 2: 1
  - Product 3: 1
  - Product 4: 1
  - Product 5: 0
  - Product 6: 1

- "Paul" row:

The table is positioned within the arms of two large curly brackets, with the left bracket extending from the topmost to the bottommost row and the right bracket closing at the bottom of Product 6’s column.
