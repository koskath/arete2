• The image contains a matrix titled "Consider this user-item matrix (normalized):"
• An equation is shown with \( X = \) followed by a vertically arranged set of labels and data enclosed in two braces.
• There are five row labels: "John," "Paul," "George," "Ringo," and "Yoko," written on the left side.
• Six column headings are labeled "Product 1" to "Product 6."

Matrix Elements:
- Product 1:
  - For "John": \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \)
