The image consists of two main sections: text at the top and a scatter plot at the bottom.

**Text:**

1. The first line states: "As with density-based clustering, problem with differing densities."
2. The second line reads: "Outlier o₂ has similar density as elements of cluster C1."
3. The third line mentions: "Basic idea behind local distance-based methods:"
4. A bullet point follows: "• Outlier o₂ is 'relatively' far compared to its neighbors."

**Scatter Plot:**

- The plot is enclosed in a square frame.
- There are three groups of points labeled as clusters and outliers:

  1. **Cluster C₁**: 
     - Located in the upper right area.
     - Contains a dense collection of black dots scattered within a cluster boundary.
     - The label "C₁" is placed above and slightly to the left of this cluster.
     
  2. **Cluster C₂**: 
     - Located in the lower-left area.
     - Composed of a very dense aggregation of small black dots.
     - Labeled as "C₂" with the text placed above the cluster.

  3. **Outliers**:
     - There are two individual points marked as "o₂" and "o₁".
     - "o₂" is positioned just to the right of cluster C₂, with the label to its right.
     - "o₁" is placed in the lower right side near the center, with the label directly beside it.

The clusters and labels are all enclosed within a thin black border. The background is white, and all dots, labels, and lines are in black.
