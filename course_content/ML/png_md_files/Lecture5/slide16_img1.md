The image features a detailed close-up of a flower with purple and white coloring. The flower has a central area from which six distinct structures radiate outward. Three of these structures are labeled "petal" and have a narrower base that widens toward a rounded end. These petals exhibit a gradient of white near the center fading into purple, with purple veins visible throughout.

The other three structures are labeled "sepal" and are broader than the petals. The sepals also have a gradient from white to deep purple with visible veins, but differ in shape as they are wider with a slightly more rounded end. The sepals are slightly larger than the petals. 

There is text annotation on two of these structures; the word "sepal" has an arrow pointing to one of the larger, broader structures, and "petal" has an arrow pointing to one of the narrower structures.

The background of the image is composed of various blurred green shapes, likely leaves or stems of plants, with slightly varying shades of green. The central focus on the flower makes the actual structure and details of the background less distinct.
