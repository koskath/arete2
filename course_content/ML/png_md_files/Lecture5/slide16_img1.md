The Iris dataset is widely used in machine learning for classification tasks. It comprises measurements of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, belonging to three species. 

In the context of deep learning and data handling, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dataset's dimensionality. By transforming the original features into a smaller set while preserving the variance, PCA facilitates easier visualization and can improve the efficiency of algorithms by reducing computational complexity. This preprocessing step is crucial for handling large datasets and is frequently used before feeding data into machine learning models to enhance performance and interpretability.
