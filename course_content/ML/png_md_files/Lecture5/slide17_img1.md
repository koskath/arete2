The image compares the original and compressed versions of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a common benchmark in machine learning for image processing. On the left, you see the "Original" images, and on the right, the "Compressed" images.

This compression likely involves a technique such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which reduces dimensionality while preserving variance. In this case, 95% of the variance is maintained. This process is crucial in deep learning and machine learning because it reduces data size and complexity, allowing for faster processing and more efficient storage without significantly compromising information quality. Such compressed data can still train models effectively, making MNIST a practical example of impactful data handling techniques.
