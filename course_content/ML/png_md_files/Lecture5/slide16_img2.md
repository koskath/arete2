The image is a scatter plot with a total of three clusters of dots. The background is white, and the plot is labeled in black text at the top: "2 components, captures 97.76% of total variation."

Axes:
- The x-axis is labeled "PC1" and ranges from -4 to 4, marked at intervals of 1. The tick marks are at -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The y-axis is labeled "PC2" and ranges from -1.5 to 1.5, marked at intervals of 0.5. The tick marks are at -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5.

Data points:
- Three distinct colored scatter clusters can be observed.
  - The first cluster on the left consists of purple dots centered around PC1 = -3 and ranging approximately from -3.5 to -2 in the x-axis. On the y-axis, they span from about -1 to 1. The shape is mostly vertical.
  - The second cluster is cyan, located in the middle of the plot. It ranges from approximately 0 to 2 on the x-axis and approximately -1 to 1 on the y-axis. This cluster is slightly diagonal, leaning downwards to the right.
  - The third cluster on the right is yellow, with data points extending roughly from PC1 = 1 to 4. On the y-axis, they span from about -0.5 to 1.5. This cluster is also spread diagonally, similar to the cyan cluster.

Overall, the scatter plot visually represents the distribution of three clusters of data points in two dimensions (PC1 and PC2), with the three colors (purple, cyan, yellow) differentiating between the clusters.
