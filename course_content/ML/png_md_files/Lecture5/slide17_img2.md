The image contains text, formatted as code. The code snippet consists of three lines:

1. `pca = PCA(n_components = 154)`
   - This line initializes a variable `pca` by calling a function `PCA` with the parameter `n_components` set to `154`.
   - The number `154` is highlighted in light orange color.

2. `X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X_train)`
   - This line assigns to the variable `X_reduced` the result of calling the method `fit_transform` on the `pca` object, passing `X_train` as an argument.

3. `X_recovered = pca.inverse_transform(X_reduced)`
   - This line assigns to the variable `X_recovered` the result of calling the method `inverse_transform` on the `pca` object, using `X_reduced` as an argument.

The entire text is written in a monospace font, characteristic of code editors. The background is white, and the text is dark blue, except the highlighted number `154`, which is in light orange.
