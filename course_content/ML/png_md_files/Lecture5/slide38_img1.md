The image contains a mathematical equation presented in a clear, serif font. The equation reads as follows:

\[ G_i = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^{n} p_{i,k}^2 \]

Details:

1. The equation starts with the variable \( G_i \), where \( G \) is an uppercase italicized letter, and \( i \) is a subscript in italic.

2. An equal sign "=" follows \( G_i \).

3. Next is the number "1", representing a constant.

4. A minus sign "-" follows "1".

5. The summation symbol \(\sum\) is prominently displayed, indicating a summation process.

6. Below the summation symbol, there is \( k=1 \) written in smaller font to denote the starting index of the summation.

7. Above the summation symbol, there is \( n \) in smaller font, indicating the upper limit of the summation.

8. To the right of the summation symbol, the variable \( p_{i,k}^2 \) is shown. Here:
   - \( p \) is a lowercase italicized letter.
   - \( i,k \) serves as the subscript with \( i \) and \( k \) both in italic.
   - The "2" appears as a superscript to denote squaring.

The entire expression is provided in a linear format, typical for mathematical equations in printed or digital documents.
