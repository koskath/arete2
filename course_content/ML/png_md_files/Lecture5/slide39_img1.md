The image contains a mathematical formula expressed in a single line:

1. The equation begins with the variable \( H_i \).
2. There is an equal sign \( = \) following \( H_i \).
3. After the equals sign is a negative sign \( - \).
4. Following the negative sign is a summation symbol \( \sum \).
5. Above the summation symbol is the variable \( n \).
6. Below the summation symbol is \( k = 1 \).
7. To the right of the summation symbol is the expression \( p_{i,k} \log_2 (p_{i,k}) \).
8. The expression \( p_{i,k} \) is represented with subscripts \( i \) and \( k \).
9. The logarithm in the expression is to the base 2, indicated as \( \log_2 \).
10. The argument of the logarithm is in parentheses: \( (p_{i,k}) \).
11. Below the entire summation expression, next to the summation symbol, there is an annotation \( p_{i,k} \neq 0 \).
